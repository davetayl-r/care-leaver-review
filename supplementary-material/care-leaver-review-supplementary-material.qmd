The program also has an outreach component which involves active recruitment of young people into the program and short-term case-management services.

#### Intended outcomes

The intended outcomes of the LST program of Los Angeles County are that young people develop the skills they require for independent living, complete their high-school education and move on to higher-education or training.

#### Eligibility criteria

To be enrolled in the LST program, young people need to:

-   reside within the program catchment area,
-   be aged 16 or older at referral to the program,
-   be in a foster care placement under the guardianship of the Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) or on probation,

#### Delivery

<b>Length of support:</b> The program lasts for approximately five weeks.

<b>Mode of delivery:</b> The LST program comprises two elements: (1) A brief classroom-based intervention offered in a convenient community college setting which covers core competency areas related to life skills and independent living. Although usually classroom-based, workshop instructors are allowed flexibility in material delivery and sessions may take the form of out-of-classroom practical activities (e.g. taking public transportation, or grocery shopping) or involve guest speakers. Pre- and post-assessments are carried out to evaluate progress in skill acquisition. Transportation, food and money are offered to remove barriers to attendance. (2) 'Outreach' or short-term case-management support offered by 'Outreach Advisors' (OAs) -- typically college graduates with experience in youth work. OAs also take an active role in recruiting young people to the program, usually by visiting the young person in their home. Peer Counsellors, former foster youth and, typically, LST graduates also provide classroom assistance to the workshop instructors and general support for program operations.

<b>Intensity of support:</b> The classroom-based component involves 30 hours of life skills training, offered as three-hour classes, twice a week over a five-week period. One-to-one case management support is also available during this time.

<b>Access to implementation support:</b> OAs receive (initial and ongoing) training and an 'Outreach Advisor Training Manual' is also provided. Workshop instructors are provided with workshop curriculum and quarterly training.

### Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youths in Intensive Foster Care

#### Description

The 'Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youths in Intensive Foster Care' (or 'Outreach' program) aims to support young people as they transition out of intensive foster care into independent living. Outreach workers provide one-to-one assistance, tailored to the young person's self-identified needs and goals. program activities are geared towards providing a sense of support to the young person, through the development of a trusting relationship with their Outreach worker, while also enabling participants to develop skills and resources for independent living through hands-on assistance in practical tasks (e.g. in accessing available financial support, obtaining housing, applying for further education or employment, and facilitating referrals to appropriate services).

#### Intended outcomes

The primary goals of the Outreach program are to support young people leaving intensive foster care to develop the skills, connections and capital that they will need to live as an independent adult. While intended outcomes vary according to participant needs, a particular emphasis is placed on the acquisition of life skills, participation in further education and/or securing employment and the development of supportive relationships.

#### Eligibility criteria

To be enrolled in the Outreach program, young people need to:

-   be in intensive foster care under the guardianship of Massachusetts Department of Children and Families;\
-   be aged 16 or older at referral to the program; and\
-   have a goal of living independently.

#### Delivery

<b>Length of support:</b> The program duration is not fixed, however, on average young people received support for 22 months: 16 months of hands-on assistance, followed by six months of intermittent check-ins.

<b>Mode of delivery:</b> The program is delivered by Outreach workers, under supervision from Outreach supervisors. Outreach workers work to (a) develop and follow a plan with the young person through initial and ongoing assessment of their needs and goals, (b) have weekly meetings during which they provide hands-on, individualized support in achieving the young person's goals (e.g. applying for higher education or employment), and (c) refer participants to other services as appropriate. Once a young person is assessed as having met the goals set out in their personal plan, weekly 'assistance' meetings are concluded and the young person is moved to 'tracking' status for approximately six months, during which time the Outreach worker maintains intermittent contact with the young person before discharging them from the program.

<b>Intensity of support:</b> Outreach workers typically meet with young people on a weekly basis; however, young people can request more or less frequent meetings depending on their needs.

<b>Access to implementation support:</b> Outreach workers receive formal pre-service training and informal training through shadowing colleagues 'on the job'. Ongoing training is available, and Outreach supervisors provide weekly supervision.

### TAKE CHARGE

#### Description

The TAKE CHARGE program is a coaching and workshop-based intervention, designed to enhance self-determination and improve outcomes for vulnerable young people in the transition to adulthood. Though originally developed for all young people, the model was designed to be accessible for young people with disabilities and was adapted specifically for young people who are both in foster care and receiving special education support.

#### Intended outcomes

The intended outcomes of the TAKE CHARGE program are that participants enhance their 'self-determination' skills and are able to identify and work towards self-identified 'transition' goals.

#### Eligibility criteria

To be enrolled in the TAKE CHARGE RCT, young people need to:

-   reside in the program catchment area;
-   be receiving special education support;
-   be in foster care (for at least 90 days) under the guardianship of Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS); and
-   be aged 16.5 to 17.5 years.

#### Delivery

<b>Length of support:</b> The program lasts for approximately 12 months.

<b>Mode of delivery:</b> The program model comprises two elements: (1) weekly coaching and (2) group workshops. Weekly one-on-one coaching sessions aim to support young people to develop self-determination skills (e.g. goal setting, problem solving, partnership development and self-regulation); to identify their own 'transition-related' goals; and to work towards achieving their goals over the course of a year (through practical support and encouragement). Direct practical support (e.g. making phone calls to relevant services) is gradually faded out as the participant demonstrates increasing skill level and motivation. Participants receive a 'Self-help guide' which outlines the skill areas covered in their coaching sessions and is designed to guide them through the transition planning process. The timing of sessions is flexible to suit the needs of participants. A number of adaptations were made to TAKE CHARGE to suit the needs of young people in foster care -- including flexibility in the sequence of coaching sessions and the revision of the guide to incorporate information relevant to foster youth and the transition to independence. Coaches also liaise closely with foster parents, through monthly updates, to engage them in the process. 'Mentoring workshops' are held on a quarterly basis and focused on topics such as education, employment and transitioning out of foster care. The workshops provide an opportunity for participants to meet with other young people participating in the program and 'mentors' -- TAKE CHARGE graduates with lived experience of foster care, 3 to 4 years older, who are enrolled in higher education, employed or had experience in overcoming barriers during their own transition from foster care.

<b>Intensity of support:</b> Coaching is one-to-one and carried out weekly. Four 'Mentoring Workshops' are held, one per quarter, over the 12-month program. Coaches provide monthly updates to Foster Parents.

<b>Access to implementation support:</b> 'Mentors' received training prior to the workshops. No information was available on training or support to TAKE CHARGE Coaches.

Healthy relationships are supported through implementation of the 'Love Notes Healthy Relationships Curriculum', which is delivered as part of group workshops and individual sessions. Economic stability is covered through teaching financial literacy and job readiness in both group workshops and individual sessions. Job and internships opportunities are also available. Individual mentoring is provided using a strengths-based and motivational interviewing approach.

<b>Intensity of support:</b> Intensity depends on the module. For healthy relationships: 13 hours of group workshops and 7 hours of individual sessions are provided. For economic stability: 4 hours of group workshops and 7 hours of individual sessions are provided. If a participant has an internship, then they meet with there supervisor once a month and receive 1-4 hours of job coaching per month.

### Youth Villages LifeSet (YVLifeSet)

#### Description

The Youth Villages LifeSet (YVLifeSet) program was originally developed in 1999 by 'Youth Villages', a non-profit organisation operating a variety of residential and community-based youth programs across the United States. The manualized program is intended to help young people who are leaving foster care or juvenile justice custody to successfully transition to independent living by providing weekly, individualized, and clinically focused case management, counselling and support. Support is tailored to each young person's needs, however, issues commonly addressed include education, employment and finances, stable housing, life skills development, management of relationships, and mental health and substance use.

#### Intended outcomes

The primary goal of YVLifeSet is to support young people to make a successful transition to independent living from foster care or juvenile justice custody. Due to the individualized nature of the program, targeted outcomes are wide-ranging and tailored to the particular needs and goals of each young person. Particular emphasis is placed on maintenance of stable housing; avoidance of involvement with the criminal justice system and a reduction in risky behaviours; participation in education or vocational training; obtaining formal employment; and having improved mental health and access to social support.

#### Eligibility criteria

To be enrolled in YVLifeSet RCT, young people need to:

-   be in the custody of the child welfare system, either in foster care or in the juvenile justice system and approaching independence from state custody;
-   be contactable and interested in program services;
-   be aged 17 to 24;
-   not have a history of severe violence, mental health problems, drug use, and/or developmental delays; and
-   be assessed by program staff as capable of living independently.

#### Delivery

<b>Length of support:</b> The program lasts between nine and twelve months.

<b>Mode of delivery:</b> The program is delivered by 'Transitional Living specialists' ('TL specialists') with supervision from clinical supervisors, and clinical consultants. The program starts with an assessment and the development of a treatment plan based on the young person's needs and goals. TL specialists meet with the participants on a weekly basis, in their home or in convenient community locations, and engage in activities related to their personal plan. One-to-one sessions are based on three methodologies: (a) the use of evidence-informed tools (including curricula on topics such as money management and behavioural treatment strategies for issues including substance abuse); (b) counselling (oriented towards supporting the young person achieving their stated goals); and (c) appropriate action-oriented activities (e.g. taking a young person to a bank to open an account). TL specialists may also refer young people to other relevant community-based services and encourage participants to attend group social and learning activities with other program participants. An 'educational/vocational coordinator' is available to provide additional support to young people who want to go to college, enrol in vocational training or find a job. All program participants are screened for trauma and, where appropriate, have access to (12-20 weeks') therapy by trained staff. TL specialists are not typically clinically qualified but have (as a minimum) a bachelor's degree in a relevant field.

<b>Intensity of support:</b> TL specialists typically have a caseload of eight young people. Participants meet for one-hour, one-to-one meetings on a weekly basis. Young people may also attend monthly group sessions with other program participants.

<b>Access to implementation support:</b> TL specialists are provided with a program treatment manual which outlines the methodologies that they are expected to employ when working with young people. Training is provided in evidence-based clinical practices (e.g. motivational interviewing). Clinical supervisors provide weekly group supervision to four or five TL specialists and, in turn, clinical supervisors receive supervision from clinical consultants.
