Method: We used a two-group, cross-sectional survey to examine the effect of YEP participation on the psychological empowerment of youths aging out of Florida’s foster care system. The study sample consisted of 193 young adults (99 YEP participants and 94 non-YEP participants), ages 18–24. Four dependent variables represented the 4 dimensions of psychological empowerment: perceived control, motivation to influence, sociopolitical skills, and participatory behavior. Results: YEP participants experienced significantly higher perceived control, motivation to influence their environments, self-efficacy, and participatory behavior than non-YEP participants even when controlling for age at program entry, gender, race, time in foster care, number of placements, and geographic location. Conclusions: Findings suggest that youth empowerment is possible in child welfare systems and may be beneficial to young people aging out of foster care. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {A substantial body of evidence suggests that young people leaving public care systems are at increased risk for low educational attainment, unemployment, homelessness, physical and mental health difficulties, dependency on public assistance, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Independent living programs (ILPs), which incorporate life skills and personal development, are one strategy frequently used to improve outcomes for young people leaving care. However, the effectiveness of ILPs remains unknown. This paper systematically reviews the current evidence for ILPs, summarizing all controlled comparisons designed to evaluate their effectiveness. Reviewers were unable to find any randomized controlled trial evaluating ILPs, but the results of eight non-randomized controlled studies suggest that some ILPs may have protective effects for youth leaving the public care system. These trends were observed for outcomes related to educational attainment, employment, housing, health, and other life skills; nevertheless, the weak methodological quality of the evidence tempers the validity and generalizability of these conclusions. Further research utilizing random assignment of participants is imperative in order to draw reliable conclusions for policy and practice. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Prior research on public interventions targeting youth ageing out of public care (‘aftercare’) and related educational outcome is scarce. The ones that exist indicate that youth receiving aftercare increase their chances of accomplishing higher education and thereby lower risk of social exclusion in later adult life. Yet, little is known about the characteristics of those who receive aftercare measures compared to the ones that enter adulthood without the same support. By using Norwegian nationwide longitudinal administrative data of the total population born 1986–1990 placed in long term foster care, this article provides empirical insight on how foster youths’ resources as reflected by school performance at age 16 is related to the chances of receiving aftercare. Furthermore, it explores to what extent such a selection might mediate the relationship between aftercare service and completion of upper secondary school at age 21. The results show that medium and to some extent high-achievers are more prone to receive aftercare measures from the child welfare system. However, this selection does not explain the positive educational effects of aftercare. Staying in foster care beyond the age of 18 has a strong positive effect on completion of upper secondary school which is not altered when taking selection into account.},

	abstract = {Background: Youth aging-out of the child welfare system (CWS) experience numerous vulnerabilities including, elevated rates of substance use and substance use disorders. Calls to improve services to transition youth to independence are common; however, evidence of the long-term impacts associated with transitional service utilization is scarce. Further, existing services frequently lack appropriate supports for substance using youth and it is unknown if youth are able to access such services. In the present study, we assess the relationship between transitional service utilization and health and social outcomes among a cohort of people who use drugs (PWUD) that aged-out of the CWS.
Methods: Data were obtained from two harmonized cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. Those who re­ ported aging-out were asked about service utilization, availability, barriers, and interest across seven categories of transitional services. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between having previously utilized transitional services and current health and social outcomes.
Results: Between December 2014 and November 2017, 217 PWUD reported having previously aged-out of the CWS. Across service categories, reported service utilization prevalence ranged from 16.6-61.8\% while unmet demand ranged from 64.8-78.4\%. In multivariable analyses, compared to individuals who utilized ≤1 service while aging-out, having utilized 4-7 services was significantly associated with reduced odds of current home­ lessness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.29) and engaging in daily drug use (AOR=0.35) (both p{\textless}0.05).
Conclusion: Findings suggest that this understudied high-risk population of PWUD and aged-out of the CWS experience long-term benefits associated with transitional service utilization and are interested and willing to engage in these services. However, given high unmet demand, findings also highlight considerable gaps in service delivery and support calls for extending the age of emancipation for all youth in the CWS and in par­ ticular, for additional harm reduction and substance use supports embedded into service models.},

We wanted to see if formal mentoring programs improved outcomes for those aging out of foster care and the Journey Up Mentorship Program in Salt Lake City offered such a program. Forty-nine youth who had aged out of foster care with the help of mentors were surveyed and found they scored significantly higher in their ability to get jobs and were less at risk for addiction, homelessness, and incarceration compared to data from the National Youth in Transition for Utah. Fifteen additional youth were interviewed in focus groups to explore the results further. Qualitative data showed participants were not less at risk given their stories, and benefited from mentors’ consistency, positive role modeling, and lessons on being an adult. This is consistent with other studies on the topic of mentoring but should be expanded into more specified comparative studies and use larger sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Post-secondary students transitioning from foster care face a range of unique challenges to academic engagement and success, and the typical mental health stressors experienced by college-age young adults are exacerbated by experiences of trauma common to those with foster care experience. Many campuses have introduced specialized support programs for these students, but few have been rigorously tested. This study is the first identified ran­ domized experiment to evaluate a post-secondary support program for enrolled college students with foster care backgrounds and mental health challenges. We report findings from a pilot intervention study testing the Project Futures model, which includes one-on-one coaching from near-peers around self-determination and self-efficacy related to mental health, academics, and other inhibitors of educational success. Overall, though this was a small pilot RCT (N = 35), analysis showed evidence of intervention impact on important targeted outcomes at postintervention and/or 6-month follow-up, including self-determination, career-related self-efficacy and career exploration activities, and mental health self-efficacy and empowerment. Further, compared to the control group, intervention participants had a higher reported GPA and were more likely to still be enrolled in school at follow-up. The study findings suggest that such structured coaching approaches can increase self-determination and self-efficacy in ways that may impact retention and potentially degree completion for foster youth. We discuss these findings in the context of specialized campus support programming for youth with foster care histories, as well as important limitations in our study, and recommendations for future research, practice, and policy.},

	abstract = {Children in foster care lead their lives at an increased risk for mental health issues. Often, these are complicated by the unstable and unpredictable nature of their living arrangements and interpersonal relationships. As such, there is substantial need to examine brief therapies and interventions for use with children in foster care and children who have experienced similar trauma and instability. The present study is a pilot investigation of the efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention targeting help-seeking behavior and assertiveness skills provided to a sample of children in foster care (N = 23). Three, 30-min group sessions of a targeted assertiveness skills intervention were developed and conducted on a sample of children in foster care and compared to an assessment-only control group. Measures of assertive tendencies, emotions towards seeking help, and assertive help-seeking skills were collected at pretest and posttest to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Participants who received the intervention significantly improved on measures of general assertiveness, F(1, 20) = 9.672, p {\textless} 0.01, d = 1.33, MD = 2.73, 95\% CI [− 0.90, 4.56], and assertiveness skills, F(1, 20) = 24.237, p {\textless} 0.01, d = 1.78, MD = 15.54, 95\% CI [8.96, 22.13], though not on the measure of emotions towards situations in which they would use these skills to seek help, F(1, 20) = 2.218, p = 0.152, d = 0.37, MD = 6.36, 95\% CI [− 2.55, 15.28]). These findings provide preliminary support for the use of a brief intervention to teach assertiveness and helpseeking skills to a population of children in the foster system who are uniquely in need of brief intervention due to the instability of their living arrangements. Limitations, future directions, and implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Methods: We use state administrative data (N = 37,470 admissions) and multivariate multilevel modeling with a difference-in-difference approach, and a non-IC comparison group, to determine if the IC resulted in improved access and retention, affected client selection, or improved outcomes for people with alcohol and drug use disorders. Propensity score techniques adjusted for pre-period differences between the IC and non-IC agencies. Program director interviews collected information on the activities implemented in response to the IC and quality activities more broadly, to understand the context for any potential changes or lack of changes once the IC was in place.
Results: The probability of receiving 4 or more outpatient treatment sessions did not change significantly between the 2005–07 pre-period and the 2008–11 post-period and was not significantly different in the IC agencies from the non-IC agencies (p = 0.643). Similarly there was no significant change between IC and non-IC over time in waiting time or the probability of remaining in treatment for 90 days or more. Admission rates of people with diagnosed mental disorders did not indicate selection effects. Early substance use and criminal justice outcomes showed little difference across IC and non-IC groups over time. While most program directors acknowledged making changes to respond to the IC system, they quickly became acclimatized to the IC, with incentives not a large driver in changing how they approach care or do business. The incentives are mostly used directly for operating costs. Non-IC programs are less likely to think of quality and outcomes measurement in a precise way.
Conclusions: Introduction of an IC is a significant change in payment design that may affect how addiction treatment services are delivered, thus increasing our understanding of its effects is critical. We find the overall net effect of incentivized contract is very small and not significant. Funded by NIDA R01 DA033402.},

This paper is drawn from a study comprising six focus groups, involving 21 participants employed in disability and OoHC services in Victoria, Australia. The findings suggest that care leavers with disabilities do not receive the transitional and postcare support and housing they need. Many are transitioned into housing options that are unsuitable for their needs, or unsafe. The argument of this paper is that care leavers with disabilities may benefit from adult guardianship legislation. When appropriate an application for a guardianship order should be made prior to the young person exiting care, to enable a smooth transition between the child and adult systems. Adult protection services with an advocacy function should be given the opportunity to advocate for care leavers with disabilities.},

	abstract = {This paper is the ﬁrst study to use a multi-state sample to longitudinally explore the relationship between remaining in foster care beyond age 18, behavioral health needs, and receipt of behavioral healthcare services. The study began with a sample of 732 older youth in foster care and followed them longitudinally for six years, after all had aged-out of care. Indicators of behavioral health and receipt of behavioral healthcare services were measured, as well as whether or not remaining in foster care after one's 18th birthday made a difference in receiving behavioral healthcare services. We found a high need for behavioral healthcare services in the years following their 18th birthdays and a signiﬁcant drop-off in service use after exiting foster care. We also found a strong relationship between remaining in care after one's 18th birthday and receipt of behavioral healthcare services among those in need. Policy implications discussed highlight the possible role of Medicaid on young adults who have aged-out of foster care with behavioral healthcare service needs, and the potential impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Among the treatment implications are the need for highly effective behavioral healthcare services for older youths in foster care and the need for receipt of ongoing services upon exiting foster care.},

A second group of youth was served in similar transitional housing programs that were not exclusively for foster care alumni but instead served homeless youth in general. Comparisons between these two groups reveal that youth in the populationspeciﬁc programs have less acute initial presentations than foster care alumni in homelessness intervention programs, who had faced more unemployment, school attrition, substance use, and mental health concerns prior to program admission than their peers in the programs speciﬁcally for foster care alumni. The research also shows that youth in the homelessness intervention programs had faced more instability during their years in foster care when compared to youth in the population-speciﬁc programs for foster care alumni. The research highlights the need for better understanding of the referral process for youth aging out of foster care so that transitional housing programs for young adult foster care alumni can better serve a diversity of youth with different service needs.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a residential program with comprehensive wrap-around services for pregnant and parenting foster care youth with severe mental illness or severe emotional disturbance who are preparing to transition to independent living. Methods: Twenty-five females ages 18 to 21 participated. Program effectiveness was determined by tracking monthly status changes, such as education, employment, and hospitalizations, as well as by comparing scores on four bi-annually administered standardized assessments of parenting competency and stress, child maltreatment risk, and mental health symptoms. Results: Assessment findings indicate that program participation is associated with positive changes in participants' familial relationships, family responsibility and care, proper parenting behavior and feelings, and parental distress and competency, but no change in mental health symptoms. Positive behavior changes associated with program participation were observed in education, employment, and low numbers of suspected and substantiated child maltreatment reports. Negative behavior changes associated with the program were frequency of AWOL incidents and subsequent pregnancies. Conclusions: This is the first study  to evaluate a program designed for this very unique population and has implications for program design and policy. Future research with more rigorous experimental design is necessary in order to understand the critical ingredients of programs serving this vulnerable population.

This study investigated the extent to which involvement in prosocial activities is associated with natural mentoring among youth at risk of emancipation. Method: Using data from the Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs, we applied multinomial logistic regression to test the association between involvement in prosocial activities and natural mentoring among 720 foster youths, ages 14-17, who were at risk of emancipation. Results: Controlling for demographic and child-welfare characteristics, foster-youth participation in hobbies/activities decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 57\%, having only formal mentors by 60\%, and having only foster parents by 49\%. Participation in organizations/clubs decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 42\%, and having only foster parents by 42\%. Participation in religious services decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 43\%, and having only foster parents by 37\%. Conclusion: This study contributes to our understanding of modifiable environmental factors that policymakers and practitioners may promote to facilitate natural mentoring relationships among foster youth at risk of emancipation.

We conducted a 20-month longitudinal randomized control trial of a pilot Wraparound program for youth in foster care and involved in the juvenile justice system (n = 24), comparing outcomes with youth receiving community “treatment as usual” (TAU; n = 23). Youth in both groups experienced significantly improved outcomes, including fewer arrests and greater residential stability. Wraparound youth were less likely to be rearrested (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = [0.17, 2.04]), and survival analysis found they went longer before doing so than TAU youth. Wraparound youth were also more likely to be educationally on track than TAU youth by the end of the study (OR = 4.09, 95\% CI = [1.89, 18.72]). Although these findings were nonsignificant at p {\textless} .05 due to small sample sizes, effect sizes were medium to large, and no such trends were found for the TAU group. Implications for Wraparound’s implementation and effectiveness, as well as the strengths and limitations of conducting a randomized control trial in “real-world” systems, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine how common teenage pregnancy is among young women in and aging out of foster care and to determine whether the risk of becoming pregnant can be reduced by extending foster care beyond age 18. The study used data from the ﬁrst two waves of the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth, a longitudinal study of foster youth making the transition to adulthood in three Midwestern states, as well as the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Cox proportional hazard models were estimated to examine the relationship between care status and the risk of teenage pregnancy. Foster youth are more likely to experience teenage pregnancy than their peers in the general population but staying in care seems to mitigate their risk of becoming pregnant even after the effects of other factors are taken into account. Our ﬁndings provide additional evidence of the need for a more concerted effort by child welfare agencies to help youth in foster care avoid becoming pregnant and suggest that allowing young people to remain in foster care beyond age 18 may be one way to reduce teenage pregnancy among this population.},

Previous studies have examined youth- and policy-level factors’ inﬂuence on EFC participation and human capital outcomes (e.g., education, employment). Still, few studies have examined contextual factors (e.g., county characteristics). We explore how local contexts, or county-level attributes, inﬂuence youths’ EFC participation and human capital outcomes (i.e., postsecondary education enrollment and earnings). We analyze two datasets from California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study: survey data with rich youth-level information (n = 529) and state child welfare administrative data with a larger sample size (n = 2392). After controlling for a wide range of youth characteristics and adjusting between-county variations, regression results ﬁnd that several county characteristics predict youths’ EFC participation and human capital outcomes at age 21, such as political atmosphere and worker’s satisfaction with cross-system collaboration. We conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.},

	abstract = {Career readiness preparation is essential to successful employment outcomes for young people in foster care who are often disrupted in their vocational development as a consequence of their challenging life circumstances. Eﬀorts by social service providers, however, to prepare young people in foster care for economic self-suﬃciency have met with varying success. The purpose of this paper is to oﬀer ﬁndings from a formative evaluation of Works Wonders, a career readiness program for young people in care, that contribute to the understanding of the factors that aﬀect their career preparation, self-determination and work outcomes as they transition from foster care to the adult world of work. Works Wonders included a career club that provided the skills and knowledge to explore career options, prepare for a job search (e.g., preparing a resume, learning how to interview, drafting cover letter), conduct a job search and retain the job once secured (e.g., relational competencies important for being eﬀective in the workplace.) The program also provided individual support around career planning, and hands-on work experiences. One hundred and eighty randomly selected young people between the ages of 14 and 21 who were in Rhode Island's foster care system or alumni of care were enrolled over ﬁve years. Interviews with young people and staﬀ service records provided information about program engagement, career readiness, self-determination, and work status. Data were collected at enrollment, after completion of career club (about six months following enrollment) and 12 months following enrollment. Results support a signiﬁcant relationship between career readiness and employment. Young people who completed the career club and participated in a hands-on work experience while in enrolled in the program were more likely to be working at follow-up compared to those that dropped out. Self-determination also increased for young people who completed the group compared to those who did not.},

Results from multilevel regression analyses ﬁnd that foster youth in states with widely available tuition waiver programs increases the odds of connectedness to school. The amount of time youth spend in extended foster care, as well as receipt of postsecondary education aid and services, also increases connectedness. Study ﬁndings underscore the importance of material and relational supports in supporting foster youths’ connection to employment and education in early adulthood.},

	abstract = {This dissertation contains three essays examining foster care alumni in young adulthood, focusing on indicators of economic stability as youth transition from foster care to independence, and on early childbirth and the intergenerational transmission of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The first paper uses the Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs: Chafee Independent Living Project, a longitudinal sample of youth aging out of foster care (n=451) participating in an experimental evaluation of Independent Living Services, to examine financial management advice and indicators of economic wellbeing. Logit regression results indicate youth receiving financial advice while in care were less likely to be unbanked or be without any accessible funds. Correlations appear stronger with an increased dose of financial advice. The second and third papers use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Regression analyses compare former foster youth to groups with shared experiences of childhood adversity to seek evidence that foster youth are at unique risk, above and beyond what is afforded by exposure to child welfare involvement, maltreatment, and economic insecurity. The second study examines foster care placement as a risk factor for early childbirth in the Add Health cohort (n=10,924). Results suggest youth in foster care are at increased risk of birth by age 21, but this risk is shared by those with child welfare contact and those raised in poor homes. The third study focuses the intergenerational transmission of ACEs using a sample of parents (n=4,648). Results indicate child welfare involvement and to a lesser extent maltreatment in childhood are associated with increased risk of depression, drug use, partner violence, and economic hardship. Whereas foster care placement is also associated with greater risk of depression and economic hardship, this association does not generally differ from the comparison groups. As such, results of this study suggest that foster care placement is unlikely to have a negative effect on parental psycho-social characteristics that suggest risk of intergenerational transmission of ACEs.

	abstract = {This article presents empirical results from a study (2015–2018) on young people leaving care in Luxembourg. A special focus deals with the processes of transitioning from care to work. Education appears to be crucial for a successful transition, as it determines life chances, such as labour market chances, but so far inequality studies have neither researched transitions from care nor have the theoretical concepts developed in inequality research been used to understand the situation of care leavers. They might help to explain the different mechanisms behind the disadvantages of students in foster and residential care and their educational attainment. This paper thus attempts to theorise leaving care from an inequality perspective and the interdependencies with concepts of relational agency, taking into account the heterogeneity among care leavers, their trajectories and achievements (see also Go¨bel, Hadjar, Karl, Peters, \& Ja¨ger, 2020). The main objective of our analysis is to investigate how agency is achieved in the transition from school to work among care leavers, taking into consideration institu­ tional pathways (continuities and discontinuities) in the care and the educational system.},

	abstract = {Background: Young people experiencing homelessness accounted for about 7\% of the total homeless population in the United States in 2018. These young people are among the most marginalized youth populations and face numerous hardships. Accessing and connecting with provider organizations is challenging for these young people for myriad reasons related to their marginalization and vulnerability. As a result, homeless and unstably housed youth exhibit low rates of health and social service utilization, despite high rates of need.
Objectives: (1) To document the development of a mobile web-based app called Youth Matters: Philly (YMP) for young people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing that is designed to help them search, identify, locate, and utilize Philadelphia-based social and health services; and, (2) To explore youth’s perceptions of the usability, usefulness, and accessibility of YMP.
Methods: We used the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess young people’s perceptions of YMP’s usability, usefulness, and accessibility. Ten young people who either were currently experiencing homelessness/unstable housing or recently had experienced such hardship participated in the study. During a two-week window, participants logged onto YMP at least three times and searched for resources. They then completed the MARS. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 25 years old (M = 21.5 years; SD = 2.3 years), mostly female (67\%), and mostly black/African American (67\%). Thirty percent identiﬁed as Hispanic/Latinx. All had spent time in foster care and aged out, with an average length of 8.1 years in care (SD = 4.0 years). We used Qualtrics to collect all data and descriptive statistics to analyze all data in SPSS.
Results: The mean scores on the subscales of the MARS (Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Information) ranged from 3.60 (Aesthetics) to 3.98 (Functionality; Information) out of 5. The mean score for overall Quality was 3.47 (out of 5). We also asked a set of questions speciﬁc to YMP to assess perceived impact of the app on the respondents’ awareness, knowledge, attitudes, help seeking, and behavior change related to experiencing homelessness and unstable housing. For all questions, at minimum, all participants “somewhat agreed.”
Conclusions: YMP is a promising way to increase engagement and overcome barriers to accessing services for youth experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. Findings oﬀer insights into ways to improve future versions of YMP. YMP also oﬀers a model for other localities committed to improving access to services for young people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. Future research directions for YMP and similar technology are discussed.},

We explore how former foster youth who aged out of care in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa are faring in the labor market at age 24 and what explains variability in employment and wages for these youth. We utilize multilevel models to analyze youth's employment using four waves of the Midwest Study. Our ﬁndings point to a critical need to better understand and address barriers to education, causes of substantial racial disparities, and characteristics of family foster homes that facilitate youths' employment. We ﬁnd that youth who remain in care past age 18 attain higher educational credentials which translate into better employment outcomes. This research also highlights the need for policies directed at current and former foster youth who become early parents.},

First, a comparative analysis using survey data describes characteristics of former foster youth who were enrolled in an ILP while in foster care (N=81) compared to those who were not (N=113). Second, an ethnographic analysis using interview data with ILP coordinators in nine California counties describes typical and unique ILP services, as well as the impact of recent federal policy changes on ILPs. Survey results indicated that ILP participants were more likely to be African American or Mexican American/other Latino, and while in foster care, they tended to be placed in nonrelative placements, had more out-of-home placements, and were more likely than non-ILP participants to have been taught a number of independent living skills. Ethnographic results indicated that ILP services typically use an instructional model that focuses on teaching discrete and concrete skills considered to be associated with self-sufficiency, and recent legislation has increased funding and flexibility in ILP services. Implications and recommendations for ILPs are discussed.},

These youth averaged 18 years of age and remained in the program an average of 10 months. At the time of discharge at age 19, 58\% of these young adults had completed high school, 32\% were employed, and 38\% were living independently; 11\% had achieved all three aforementioned outcomes. An exploratory principal components factor analysis of nineteen dichotomous risk factor items assessed by clinical staff at the time of admission yielded four types of risk: mental health problems, delinquency issues, teen parenting, and cognitive impairment. Logistic regression analysis revealed a number of signiﬁcant relationships between each of these four clinical risk factors and client outcomes after adjusting for demographic and program characteristics. Those with mental health problems were only half as likely as others to have attained all three outcomes. Parenting youth were only half as likely to have completed high school or to be employed as others. Those with delinquency issues were only one-fourth as likely than others to be independently housed at discharge. Finally, older youth and those remaining in the program longer showed more favorable outcomes than others. Implications for child welfare policy and practice pertaining to independent living are discussed.},

Methods: This study examined a sample of all 194 GSP students ages 17 to 30 who received services from the Guardian Scholars Program between 2005 and 2017.
Results: The program saw an 84\% sophomore year retention rate, an 82\% overall retention rate, and a 70\% sixyear graduation rate. These outcomes are better than the outcomes for the SF State general population of students, SF State Pell Grant recipients, and nationwide public university students.
Conclusions: Although descriptive in nature, this study oﬀers early evidence that comprehensive campus support programs may lead to improved academic outcomes for foster youth in undergraduate studies at four-year universities.},

Outcomes, including youth self-determination, quality of life, employment, mental health, educational achievement and independent living, are assessed pre-intervention, at the conclusion of intervention, and at 12 months post-intervention. The proposed study will provide important information on the efficacy of the model for all youth exiting the foster care system, yielding unequivocal data on whether enhanced self-determination mediates, at least partially, various outcome areas, including mental health, educational achievement, employment, independent living, and quality of life; evaluating the effect of special education status, gender, and race as moderating influences on the impact of the intervention. Foster care experiences, such as trauma and placement instability, will be considered as covariates; direct effects of the intervention on these key foster care experiences will also be explored.},

The objectives of the True North program are to: 1) offer targeted, evidence-based healthy relationship interventions to the program group; 2) offer financial literacy to the program group in order for the participants to achieve greater economic stability; 3) provide job readiness sessions and connect the program group to subsidized and unsubsidized employment opportunities; and 4) match the young adults in the program group with a mentor to provide a permanent connection for guidance with relationship and financial issues.

The overall hypothesis is that participation in the True North program will increase the likelihood that the young adults will improve their relationships, improve their financial and employment stability, and improve their wellbeing.},

The current study uses random assignment to evaluate the impact of an individualized, home-based tutoring program on the academic performance and educational outcomes of a group of adolescent foster youth in Los Angeles County, CA. Data were collected via multi-wave, in-person interviews of 465 foster youth. No statistically signiﬁcant impacts are found on any included measures of academic ability or other educational outcomes.

	abstract = {Of the substantial literature on interventions to improve the poor health of children in out of home care, little focuses on lifestyle factors such as physical activity. This review identifies if physical activity interventions are effective for this population, and if so which type of activity and for what health outcomes. A systematic review of 14 social science and physical activity databases was conducted in November 2019. Included articles examined the effect of a physical activity intervention on any health or wellbeing outcome, for children or adolescents under 20 years of age whose primary condition for admission to care was abuse, neglect or parental incapacity. A final 12 studies were identified, dated from 1989 to 2019, covering nine countries and with a mix of designs; eight Randomised Control Trials (RCT’s), three single group trials and one qualitative study. Most interventions showed benefit, with the best evidence for rhythmic movement on visual motor integration and behaviour, yoga in relation to balance, flexibility and muscle strength, and initiative or general recreation activities for self-concept, self-efficacy and general psychological temperament. However, for some studies the effect may be moderated by other co-occurring interventions, like group social activities. Further research is required before these results could be confidently generalised across different settings, with particular gaps in relation to children and young people residing in foster or kinship care and for studies examining the effect of sports participation. The results of this review indicate that physical activity could be an effective intervention to address health concerns for children in out of home care and should therefore be considered in policies and program design. It is important to note that specific types of activity could not yet confidently be recommended over others.},

These interviews revealed the need for better university outreach and information to prospective care-leaver students, improved support for enrolled care-leaver students, and better capturing of data by universities and governments.

This study examined homelessness among youth transitioning out of foster care by incorporating individual-level and county-level influences to better understand the risk of homelessness among this population. Multilevel models and generalized estimating equation models were constructed to include both individual- and county-level variables. Data were obtained from multiple national datasets: the 2011-2015 National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), 2011 Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), University of Wisconsin’s County Health Rankings \& Roadmaps Data and the 2013 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural-Urban Continuum Code data file.The analytic sample included 3,968 youth who responded to the NYTD Wave 1 (age 17), Wave 2 (age 19) and Wave 3 (age 21) survey. Of the sample, 35.3\% experienced homelessness between 17–21 years old. Findings indicated statistically significant variation between counties in the proportion of youth who become homeless. Multiple individual-level factors were found to predict homelessness between ages 17–21. Prior homelessness, substance use history, and incarceration had a positive relationship with risk of homelessness. Connection with a caring adult, enrollment in school, and employment were inversely related to risk of homelessness. Specific to foster care experience, number of placements and age of entry had a positive relationship with risk of homelessness. Being in foster care at age 19 and at age 21 were related to a reduced risk of homelessness. Not as hypothesized, receipt of independent living services had a positive relationship with homelessness. None of the county-level indicators had a statistically significant relationship to the homelessness outcome. Policy and practice implications for child welfare include extending foster care, capturing housing histories and prioritizing housing plans for youth, and targeting intensive services to youth at the highest risk of homelessness. Future research to further examine socioeconomic community- and state-level predictors of homelessness among this population inform homelessness prevention and housing strategies for youth aging out of foster care. Suggested areas for improvement in NYTD data are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The relationship between mentoring programs and community support in the metropolitan Washington, DC area and the successful transition of youth to adulthood were explored in this study. Mentoring has been known to reduce feelings of hopelessness and improve self-efficacy, effecting support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, constructive use of time, commitment to learning, positive values, social competencies, and positive identity, which are critically important in the ability of high-risk youth to experience success as adults. This study examined the impact of mentoring on foster children's  self-efficacy as defined by Albert Bandura (Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, 1997) and subsequent outcomes as emancipated adults. Analysis included an original survey with an adapted self-efficacy scale (M. J. Nakkula \& J. T. Harris, "Youth Mentoring Survey," 2010; Search Institute, "40 Developmental Assets for Adolescents," 2007) and focus group discussions to provide a more in-depth understanding of group similarities and differences suggested by quantitative data analysis. The findings will assist with understanding the correlates of mentoring with self-efficacy of youth. There were three sections of the survey that were examined: Mentoring Program, Community Social Support, and Youth Aged Out of the Foster Care System. Each section was made of eight subscales: support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, constructive use of time, commitment to learning, positive values, social competencies, and positive identity. Internal consistency was conducted on the 20 subscales of interest to establish reliability. Of the MP subscales of interest, support and empowerment had the highest alpha coefficients (α = 1.00), indicating excellent reliability. Of the CSS subscales of interest, support and empowerment had the highest alpha coefficients (α = 1.00), indicating excellent reliability. Of the YAO subscales of interest, empowerment and constructive use of time had the highest alpha coefficients (α = 1.00), indicating excellent reliability. The alpha coefficients for the 20 subscales of interest are presented in Table 6.},

A followup study focused on how youths who graduated from this program fared in terms of their military or civilian service, housing, tertiary education, employment, income, health, leisure activities, social relations, and general satisfaction with their lives. The study was also designed to obtain a retrospective evaluation of their experience as residents in the housing provided by the program. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 25 participants revealed a complex picture of young people facing a variety of hardships, and experiencing some of the same challenges that face youths when they age out from care. Changes introduced in the program in response to the findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Nationally, the outcomes for youth aging out of foster care are dismal. Most children leaving foster care do not have the financial, medical, or social support tools necessary to bridge this transition successfully, placing a significant burden on youth leaving care (Courtney, Piliavin, Grogan, \& Nesmith in Child Welfare 80:685–717, 2001; Kools \& Kennedy in Pediatric Nursing 29(1):39–45, 2003; Simms, Dubowitz, \& Szilagyi in Pediatrics 106:909–918, 2000). Given the poor outcomes for youth aging out of foster care, and the small body of literature on what works to improve outcomes, the purpose of this study was twofold. First to examine youth characteristics associated with better outcomes, and secondly to explore what program characteristics were correlated with outcomes. A causal comparative research design was used, employing pre-existing data. Records were collected from an agency in a large urban/suburban area in the State of Texas. Data was collected from both the Transition Resource Action Center (TRAC) and Children’s Protective Services databases. To determine outcomes, both TRAC’s Self-Sufficiency Matrix and case records were used. TRAC’s Self-Sufficiency Matrix has five domains: Education, Employment, Employability, Financial Literacy, and Shelter. t tests were used to examine differences in outcomes between youth who received TRAC services before and after leaving care. t tests were also used to examine changes in overall Self-Sufficiency Matrix scores. Furthermore, linear and stepwise regressions were conducted to determine which variables were predictive of scores on the Self-Sufficiency Matrix. The results of this study indicate that TRAC is having a positive influence on the youth receiving services. Youth show significant improvement across four of the five identified domains and maintained on the fifth domain, employment. Implications for research practice and policy are presented.},

Here we focus on life satisfaction among care leavers four years after leaving care in Israel. Mixed-methods and longitudinal approaches were used to identify personal and social factors contributing to life satisfaction. The quantitative sample included 222 young people who were interviewed at three time points (T1-T3): on the verge of leaving care, one year later and four years after leaving care. Sixteen narrative interviews were conducted at T3. Both methods showed that personal resources, parental and peer support contributed to life satisfaction. The qualitative ﬁndings highlighted the complexity of care leavers' relationships with their birth parents. The interviews also demonstrated the potential contribution of other types of resources including siblings, romantic partners and stable formal support from practitioners in residential care and in the community. The ﬁndings suggest that to enhance care leavers' life satisfaction, practitioners' interventions should focus on empowering them to enhance their personal resources. In addition, the birth parents of some of the care-leavers had harmful relationships with their children and need various types of intervention to help them become a source of support for their child.},

	abstract = {Education is associated with many individual life advantages; yet disparities in educational outcomes exist for some vulnerable populations. Foster youths are young adults generally age 18-25 who were formerly wards of their state due to legal intervention resulting from parental abuse or neglect. The success of these young adults affects the well-being of society, inviting interest from policymakers and child welfare practitioners.The Independent Living Program (ILP) was introduced nationally by the federal government and is administered by states. This program assists foster youths in their transition to adulthood through various supports and services. The present study explored the effects of ILP services on the educational enrollment of foster youths beyond the legal emancipation age of 18. Logistic regression was utilized to examine relationships between the receipt of ILP services and enrollment in high school, General Education Development (GED) classes, postsecondary vocational training, or college courses while controlling for common life outcome barriers. Ethnicity and gender were also examined.The study results revealed statistically significant relationships between certain ILP services and enrollment. Results also showed youths who remained in foster care had greater odds of being enrolled. Further results indicated a statistically significant relationship between Black and Hispanic youths and enrollment in each analysis compared to White youths. Female foster youths were also found to be more likely than male foster youths to be enrolled with ILP services. Factors that decreased the odds of enrollment included past incarceration and having children.},

	abstract = {Background: The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 created the option for U.S. states to extend the foster care age limit up to the 21 st birthday. The law provides foster youth extra protections while they transition to adulthood.
Objective: To inform states’ efforts to better design and implement extended foster care (EFC), we examine the impact of the policy change on length of EFC stay and factors associated with youth’s time in EFC. Participants and setting: We use two samples of foster youth in California that extended the foster care age limit to 21 in 2012: 37,827 youths who turned 18 between the years 2008 and 2014 and 711 youths who participated in an interview-based panel study.
Methods: Leveraging California’s child welfare administrative data and California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study's (CalYOUTH) survey data, we investigated predictors of months youths remained in EFC with linear regression and Cox proportional hazard regression.
Results: Almost half of youth eligible for EFC remained in care until their 21 st birthday. These cohorts stayed in foster care up to 16 months longer (p {\textless} .001) than previous cohorts without an EFC option. Multiple individual factors were associated with youths’ length of stay in EFC. However, a youth’s county of placement made a greater difference on their time in EFC—up to 16 months (p {\textless} .05).
Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance that placement location has on how long youth remain in EFC, and expands our understanding of how county and state context shape EFC participation.},

	abstract = {Over the past 30 years, troubling outcomes of older youth in foster care have attracted attention from federal lawmakers, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders. Without sufficient resources, support, and skills necessary to transition to adult independence, these youth experience higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, educational underachievement, and unemployment than peers not involved in foster care. Promoting college degree attainment has become an explicit target of recent legislation. Many past studies have documented poor postsecondary education outcomes for foster youth, but few have investigated factors that drive these outcomes. The goal of this dissertation is to examine individual, college, and policy factors that impact postsecondary education outcomes of foster youth. Analysis of secondary data collected from the Midwest Study examines college entry and completion for a representative sample of over 700 foster youth from three Midwestern states.   The findings show that more than nine in ten 17 year-olds in foster care aspired to go to college, but 12 years later only half had made it to college and just one in ten completed a certificate or degree. Among young people who enrolled in college, six-year completion rates were substantially lower for foster youth (17\%) than for a high risk comparison group of low-income first-generation students (44\%). Results from regression analyses arrived at the following conclusions. Factors pertaining to youths’ academic history and skills and behavioral problems exerted the strongest influence on their likelihood of entering college. In terms of college persistence, youth who started college younger, who had higher reading proficiency, and who had experienced fewer foster care placement changes and school moves had higher odds of persisting. The strongest influences on college completion were life circumstances after youth had entered college (e.g., economic hardships, parental responsibilities) and characteristics of the colleges they attended. The findings also indicated that aspects of youths’ foster care histories predicted their level of avoidant attachment (i.e., emotional guardedness, reluctance to depend on others) in adolescence. In turn, youth higher in avoidant attachment had lower odds of persisting in and completing college. Finally, a policy that extended the age limit of foster care from 18 to 21 increased the likelihood that youth enrolled in college by age 21, but did not influence long-term college outcomes.   This study finds that about half of foster youth who enter college never make it past the first few semesters, and academic underpreparedness and financial hardships are formidable barriers to their college success. It is argued that early, targeted interventions that remain in place as other foster care supports phase out will be integral to supporting these young people through college. Recommendations for professionals, child welfare departments, colleges, and policy makers are offered in the concluding chapter.},

We tested three hypotheses: (a) having a greater number of institutional agents promotes college enrollment, (b) encouragement from school personnel to pursue postsecondary education promotes college enrollment, and (c) the number of institutional agents and amount of school encouragement will interact to promote college enrollment. Method: We used a representative sample of adolescents (N = 712), ages 16.75-17.75, in California foster care in 2012 (response rate = 95\%) and obtained college enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse. We used logistic regression to predict college enrollment. Results: The number of institutional agents who participants nominated, as well as encouragement from school personnel, significantly increased the likelihood of college enrollment. Findings were mediated by the amount of help youths received preparing for college and their participation in extended foster care. Reading ability, educational aspirations, and high school grades were positively associated with college enrollment. Grade repetition, placement in special education, and early parenthood decreased the likelihood of college enrollment. Conclusions: The likelihood of enrolling in college increases when foster youth have supportive relationships with adults who can leverage their positional power and mobilize college-relevant knowledge and resources.

One recommendation is that to develop human capital, foster youths must invest in higher levels of education. Second, ILP record keeping must improve and standardized outcomes must be developed to accurately measure the intervention effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Fifteen years has passed since the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program was created under the Social Security Act, which marked an increased role of the U.S. federal government in supporting foster care youth to independence. It was not until the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was launched in 2010 that all 50 states reported standard data on receipt of the 13 types of Chafee independent living services. This paper, which draws on the ﬁrst two years of NYTD data, analyzes Chafee service receipt across the U.S. among youth in foster care (ages 16–21). About half of the 131,204 youth included in this analysis received at least one type of Chafee service, and considerable variation existed in the proportion of youth that received each of the 13 speciﬁc types of services. Females were more likely than males to receive all but one type of service, and African Americans were less likely to receive most of the services. An interaction effect indicated that Black youth were signiﬁcantly less likely to receive services in large urban areas than other racial/ethnic groups. Young people with disabilities or medical/psychological conditions were generally more likely to receive services than youth without disabilities. Youth in large urban regions receive fewer services than youth residing in other areas, and substantial variation exists between states in proportions of service recipients. Recommendations are made for targeting services, future data collection, and research, including suggestions on ways to improve measurement of Chafee services.},

Equally signiﬁcant, self-reported receipt of help related to employment did not impact yearly earnings.

	abstract = {Background: The mental health outcomes among youth in foster care with disabilities are under studied. Increasing our understanding of mental health risk and protective factors is essential for improving the mental health and quality of life of this population. This study tests the associations of risk and protective factors on mental health outcome variables of youth in foster care with disabilities.
Methods: All Oregon youth in foster care who were ages 16.6–18.5 and attending study school districts were invited to participate in a federally-funded longitudinal RCT evaluation, which sought to assess the eﬀectiveness of self-determination enhancement on outcomes of youth transitioning from foster care to adult life. Only baseline data was used with a ﬁnal sample of 305. Receipt of special education services was used as the proxy for disability status. The risk factors included trauma exposure, hopelessness, placement type, perceived placement restrictiveness. The protective factors included social support and self-determination. The outcome variables included internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms, quality of life. Preliminary analyses organized by special education (SPED) involvement vs. study variables were conducted, and stepwise regressions were followed.
Results: Findings revealed SPED was associated with being in a restrictive foster placement. Youth involved in SPED reported higher perceived placement restrictiveness and hopelessness, but lower quality of life (QoL). Self-determination was a consistent protective factor. Post-traumatic symptomology was a consistent and strongest risk factor for all outcome variables.
Conclusions: Although it is not possible to change previous adverse childhood experiences that result in currently experienced trauma, well-designed self-determination enhancement interventions and the support of caring adults may reduce negative mental health outcomes and improve QoL},

Independent Living Programs (ILPs) are designed to help transition-age foster care youth. However, limited rigorous examinations have been done. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between Independent Living Programs and resilience among transition-age foster care youth. The social ecology of resilience was used to guide the secondary analysis of a sample of 917 transition-age foster youth from three ILPs of the Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs (Chafee Independent Living Evaluation Project, 2001-2010). Multilevel analyses were used to examine the impact of each ILP on resilience and the role of ILP participation on resilience in the social environmental contexts of transition-age foster care youth. The three ILPs examined in this study did not outperform services as usual. In addition, participation in the three ILPs did not significantly predict changes in resilience after controlling for individual and social environmental factors. However, gender and externalizing behavior problems at the individual level significantly predicted change in resilience. Compared to male youth, female youth presented greater positive change in resilience. When youth had lower levels of behavior problems at baseline, they were more likely to improve on resilience. Social support was the only significant predictor of change in resilience at the micro-system level; when youth had higher levels of social support at baseline, they were more likely to improve on resilience. At the meso/exo-system level, foster parent support, community participation, and child welfare status were found to be significant predictors of resilience change over time. Youth with higher levels of foster parent support were more likely to improve on resilience. Youth who participated in a community organization at baseline were more likely to increase resilience over two years. Youth in the child welfare system demonstrated higher levels of resilience than youth discharged from the system. The findings of this study underscore the role of child welfare social workers, foster parents, and the child welfare system in preparing youth for independent living.

In addition, other factors related to the risk of arrest for these former foster youth were explored. Event history modeling techniques were used to estimate the impact of extended care on the risk of a ﬁrst adult arrest. Models were estimated for men and women separately, and for all non-procedural arrests and violent arrests only. Extended care is associated with a lower risk of arrest in the ﬁrst year, but appears to have a declining effect over time.},

Yet, it is possible that youth who are also involved in the juvenile justice system may have trouble accessing these services. This study uses a social exclusion framework to examine associations between independent living service receipt, adjudication status, and early adult outcomes for youth aging out of the U.S. foster care system. Outcomes and ILS receipt data for 7412 older youth from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) were used for this study. Chi-square tests and logistic regression models were used to explore the relationships among adjudication status, ILS, social exclusion, and social connectedness at age 19. Findings indicated that postsecondary education support and education financial services at baseline were related to a higher likelihood of being socially connected and lower likelihood of being socially excluded at age 19. Being an adjudicated delinquent and receiving special education and career services were related to a lower likelihood of being socially connected. This suggests that ILS are well-suited for youth already doing well, but may not do enough for those who struggle the most during this period.},

Whilst there are a range of leaving care and post-care services funded for care leavers, these supports tend to be temporary and discretionary in contrast to the ongoing support young people receive whilst in care or, in some cases, from family and social networks post care. Numerous studies have documented the developmental challenges experienced by young people leaving state care, and the often poor outcomes faced by this group. The Stand By Me (SBM) programme was developed in Victoria to replicate the ongoing support provided in the UK to care leavers by Personal Advisers who remain available to assist young people until 21 years of age. Evaluation of the SBM programme has shown that ongoing, holistic support, including housing support, has assisted 12 young people through the SBM pilot to access stable housing, address multiple and complex issues, and form trusting relationships with SBM workers that contribute to positive outcomes.},

The program targeted young people who have had the most adverse pre-care experiences - the group of care leavers often observed to have the poorest long-term outcomes and the group least likely to access and receive transitional services as their complex needs and challenging behaviour are typically incompatible with the design of the mainstream leaving care system. The evaluation aimed to investigate how well the Personal Advisor model could be translated to the Victorian context, whether the intended short and longer term benefits were achieved, client experiences, use of time and financial resources, key effective elements, and the overall viability of the model as an investment for government.

This article uses a content analysis methodology to critically examine and compare the findings of six recent Australian child protection inquiries (five at state and territory level and one Commonwealth) in relation to their discrete sections on leaving care. Attention is drawn to how the policy issue is framed including key terminology, the major concerns identified, the local and international research evidence cited and the principal sources of information including whether or not priority is given to the lived experience of care leavers.},

Aftercare services are designed to provide support to young people when they leave care, the kinds of support most other young people receive by matter of course. Understanding how to better resource these young people is essential to improve their wellbeing. Drawing on biographical narrative interviews with 22 young people, this snapshot presents preliminary findings on young people’s experiences of accessing services after leaving OOHC.

The evaluation identified a number of effective components of the program, including the long engagement period which enabled the workers to develop trusting relationships with the young people; the holistic wrap around support that focused on working with the young people in their broader family, social and community contexts; and the availability of housing support to facilitate safe and stable housing options.},

	abstract = {The Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (Midwest Study) is a longitudinal study that has been following a sample of young people from Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois as they transition out of foster care into adulthood. It is a collaborative effort involving Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago; the University of Wisconsin Survey Center; and the public child welfare agencies in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Study provides a comprehensive picture of how foster youth are faring during this transition since the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 became law. Foster youth in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois were eligible to participate in the study if they had entered care before their 16th birthday, were still in care at age 17, and had been removed from home for reasons other than delinquency. Baseline survey data were collected from 732 study participants when they were 17 or 18 years old. Study participants were re-interviewed at ages 19 (n = 603), 21 (n = 591), 23 or 24 (n = 602), and 26 (n = 596). Because many of the questions Midwest Study participants were also asked as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, it is possible to make comparisons between this sample of former foster youth and a nationally representative sample of young people in the general population. These comparisons indicate that young people who have aged out of foster care are faring poorly as a group relative to their peers across a variety of domains. The Midwest Study also presents a unique opportunity to compare the outcomes of young people from one state (i.e., Illinois) that allows foster youth to remain in care until their 21st birthday to the outcomes of young people from two other states (i.e., Iowa and Wisconsin) in which foster youth generally age out when they are 18 years old. The data suggest that extending foster care until age 21 may be associated with better outcomes, at least in some domains.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of evidence-based medicine (EBM) recommends that physicians formulate clinical questions in terms of the problem/population, intervention, comparison, and outcome. Together, these elements comprise a PICO frame. Although this framework was developed to facilitate the formulation of clinical queries, the ability of PICO structures to represent physicians' information needs has not been empirically investigated. This paper evaluates the adequacy and suitability of PICO frames as a knowledge representation by analyzing 59 real-world primary-care clinical questions. We discovered that only two questions in our corpus contain all four PICO elements, and that 37\% of questions contain both intervention and outcome. Our study reveals prevalent structural patterns for the four types of clinical questions: therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. We found that the PICO framework is primarily centered on therapy questions, and is less suitable for representing other types of clinical information needs. Challenges in mapping natural language questions into PICO structures are also discussed. Although we point out limitations of the PICO framework, our work as a whole reaffirms its value as a tool to assist physicians practicing EBM.},

	abstract = {Youth residing in out-of-home care settings have often been exposed to childhood trauma, and commonly report experiencing adverse outcomes after transitioning from care. This meta-analysis appraised internationally published literature investigating the impact of transitional programme participation (among youth with a baseline age of 15-24 years) on post-transition outcomes of housing, education, employment, mental health and substance use. A comprehensive search of sociology (e.g. ProQuest Sociology), psychology (e.g. PsycInfo) and health (e.g. ProQuest Family Health) electronic abstraction databases was conducted for the period 1990-2014. Search terms included 'out-of-home care', 'transition', 'housing', 'education', 'employment', 'mental health' and 'substance use'. Nineteen studies, all from the United States, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Living independently and homelessness were the most commonly described housing outcomes. Rates of post-transition employment varied, while rates of post-secondary education were low. Depression and alcohol use were commonly reported among transitioning youth. Findings of the meta-analysis showed that attention should be given to the potential benefit of transitional programme participation on outcomes such as housing, employment and education. Moderator analyses showed that these benefits may differ based on study design, sample size and sampling unit, but not for mean age or gender. Detailed and rigorous research is needed internationally to examine the characteristics of transitional programmes resulting in more successful outcomes for youth, and whether these outcomes are sustained longitudinally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Independent living programmes (ILPs) are designed to provide young people leaving care with skills that will limit their disadvantage and aid in their successful transition into adulthood. Programmes focus on personal development, independent living skills, education, and vocational support. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of independent living programmes for young people leaving the care system. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005); EMBASE (1980 to June 2005); CINAHL (1982 to June 2005); PsycINFO (1887 to June 2005); Sociological Abstracts (1952 - June 2005); Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) (1987- June 2005) and Dissertation Abstracts (to June 2005). All bibliographies were cross-referenced, and experts were contacted for unpublished or ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ILPs to standard care, another intervention, no intervention, or a wait-list control, for young people leaving care systems at their country's statutory age of discharge. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: 2196 citations were identified and screened independently by two reviewers. Full text versions were obtained for 54 papers. None met the review's inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: No study was found that met the inclusion criteria of the review. Eighteen studies using nonrandomised or noncomparative designs were found, which generally reported favourable outcomes for ILP participants; however, reliable inferences cannot be drawn from these studies due to their use of weak methodology. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from randomised controlled trials show no evidence of the effectiveness of ILPs in improving or impairing outcomes for young people discharged from care. Further research into ILPs using randomised controlled designs is needed.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a fundamental shift toward greater federal responsibility for supporting foster youth during the transition to adulthood. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (“Fostering Connections Act”) amended Title IV-E to extend the age of Title IV-E eligibility from 18 to 21 years old. States may now claim federal reimbursement for the costs of foster care maintenance payments made on behalf of Title IV-E–eligible foster youth until they are 21 years old. While states have the option to extend care under the new provisions of the Fostering Connections Act, they are not required to do so. The California Fostering Connections Act and sub sequent amendments to state law extended foster care for eligible youth to age 21. Although over half of all states have adopted legislation to take up the Fostering Connections Act option of extending care past age 18 and others are considering doing so, California is arguably the most important early adopter of the new policy. California has the largest state foster care population in the US, lending national significance to what happens in California’s child welfare system.},

The large number of children in foster care and the high cost of child welfare, makes the outcomes of former foster youth a trending topic in research. However, research that combines results on different extents (education, employment, wages, housing, mental health, substance abuse and criminality) is sparse. Using the PRISMA method, the outcomes of 32 original quantitative studies were compared. The studies were categorized into two groups reflecting on the child welfare orientation of the country: child protection vs. family service (Gilbert, Parton, \& Skivenes, 2011). The results are clear as well as troubling. In both systems, children who leave care continue to struggle on all areas (education, employment, income, housing, health, substance abuse and criminal involvement) compared to their peers from the general population. A stable foster care placement, establishing a foothold in education and having a steady figure (mentor) who supports youth after they age out of care seem to be important factors to improve the outcomes.},

	abstract = {This report presents the findings of a comprehensive systematic review of the best available evidence on targeted non-clinical individual interventions aiming to improve the mental health, mental wellbeing, or happiness of vulnerable adolescents. The vulnerable groups included were: looked after and care leavers; homeless; young offenders; sexually abused; teenage parents; ethnic minorities; asylum seekers and refugees; those exposed to domestic and intimate partner violence; those living in socioeconomically deprived areas; unemployed; those out of/excluded from school; and young carers. Findings show that there was insufficient evidence to identify interventions which clearly benefit the mental health of any of the vulnerable groups included in this review. However, a small body of evidence was identified which reported some evidence on impacts on mental health for some groups. Adolescents who are or have been "looked after" or in foster care was the group for which most evidence was identified, in respect of a wide range of practical support and psychological interventions. However, it was unclear whether these interventions are beneficial or harmful for mental health. There was some, very limited, evidence that mentoring, either peer or natural may benefit wellbeing and mental health for looked after adolescents. Practical support services, in particular independent living and homelessness support interventions, and psychological interventions, in particular cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), or a package combining both practical support and psychological interventions, could benefit the mental health of homeless young people. There was some evidence to suggest that CBT can improve the mental health of young offenders. In adolescents who have been sexually abused, there was some evidence to suggest that CBT, individual or group, could lead to reduced stress and anxiety. Lastly, there was limited evidence to suggest that psychological interventions such as parenting skills and inter-personal therapy may lead to improved mental health, and it was unclear whether home visiting benefits the mental health of teenage parents. The broad scope of this review and the diversity of interventions identified prevents drawing conclusions about specific interventions. Further synthesis of evidence on specific interventions which include examination of wider sources of evidence may help shed light on promising interventions for specific groups.},

The authors address three major questions: How common is homelessness among young people making the transition from foster care to adulthood? How soon during the transition from foster care to adulthood do young people become homeless? Is there any evidence that allowing young people to remain in care until age 21 reduces homelessness? They find that far too many foster youth are still becoming homeless during the transition to adulthood. Although allowing young people to remain in care until their 21st birthday does prevent them from becoming homeless prior to age 19 and, to a lesser extent, age 21, it does not appear to reduce their risk of experiencing homelessness by age 23 or 24. They discuss the implications of our findings for both policy and practice.},

The analysis focuses on the increase in postsecondary educational attainment associated with allowing foster youth to remain in care until they are 21 years old and the resulting increase in lifetime earnings associated with postsecondary education. Researchers estimate that lifetime earnings would increase an average of two dollars for every dollar spent on keeping foster youth in care beyond age 18. (Contains 5 figures and 3 footnotes.)},

Drawing from official arrest records, event history models are used to examine the time to arrest. Because individuals may be at risk for different types of crime, competing risk regression models are used to distinguish among arrests for drug-related, nonviolent, or violent crimes. Between the ages of 17-18 and 24, 46\% of former foster youth experience an arrest. Arrests were evenly distributed across drug, nonviolent, and violent crimes columns. Although findings fail to support the significance of social bonds to interpersonal domains, bonds to employment and education are associated with a lower risk for arrest. Child welfare policy and practice implications for building connections and protections around foster youth are discussed.},

Design Prospective cohort study Setting Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Baseline interviews were conducted between May 2002 and March 2003 and follow-up interviews, between March and December 2004. Participants Participants were foster youth aged 17 or 18 years in Illinois, Wisconsin, or Iowa. We invited a random sample of 67\% of eligible Illinois youth and all eligible youth from Wisconsin and Iowa to participate. Researchers interviewed 749 at baseline (94.7\% response) and 643 at follow-up (85.8\%); we excluded 8 participants without housing data (n = 635). We included only the 345 emancipated participants in analyses of health care access. Main Exposure Housing status after emancipation: stable housing; unstable housing; or homeless. Main Outcome Measures Multivariate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of association between main exposure variables with 3 measures of access to care and 2 health outcomes. Results Among the 345 emancipated participants, 14.2\% experienced homelessness and 39.4\% were unstably housed. In multivariate analysis of emancipated participants, homelessness was associated with being uninsured (AOR, 3.41; 95\% confidence interval, 1.52-7.63) and having unmet need for health care (AOR, 3.26; 95\% confidence interval, 1.40-7.56); it was not associated with not having had ambulatory care. In multivariate analysis of all participants, housing status was not associated with reporting fair or poor health at follow-up or, among women, with having had a pregnancy. Conclusion Having had an episode of homelessness after emancipation is associated with worse health access, but not worse outcomes, among youth emancipated from foster care.},

	abstract = {Flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate

Randomised trials, and systematic reviews of such trials, provide the most reliable evidence about the effects of healthcare interventions. Provided that there are enough participants, randomisation should ensure that participants in the intervention and comparison groups are similar with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors. Differences in outcomes of interest between the different groups can then in principle be ascribed to the causal effect of the intervention.1

Causal inferences from randomised trials can, however, be undermined by flaws in design, conduct, analyses, and reporting, leading to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect (bias).2 However, it is usually impossible to know the extent to which biases have affected the results of a particular trial.

Systematic reviews aim to collate and synthesise all studies that meet prespecified eligibility criteria3 using methods that attempt to minimise bias. To obtain reliable conclusions, review authors must carefully consider the potential limitations of the included studies. The notion of study “quality” is not well defined but relates to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis, and presentation were appropriate to answer its research question. Many tools for assessing the quality of randomised trials are available, including scales (which score the trials) and checklists (which assess trials without producing a score).4 5 6 7 Until recently, Cochrane reviews used a variety of these tools, mainly checklists.8 In 2005 the Cochrane Collaboration’s methods groups embarked on a new strategy for assessing the quality of randomised trials.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40\% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34\% of the respondents reporting more than 50\% time savings. In addition, around 75\% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

After 24 months, this first evaluation of MultifunC demonstrated that youth participating in MultifunC had a reduced need for residential care in a locked setting as well as out-of-home placement in general compared to youth in the TAU group. The economic analysis found MultifunC to be a cost-effective alternative to TAU due to the reduced need of residential care in locked settings.

This expansion raised the age limit for eligibility for aftercare from 20 years to 22 years, and created an increased focus on availability of this type of support. Using Danish administrative data and a difference-in-difference setup, I find that the expansion increased unemployment, but only in the short run, and reduced educational activities overall. It did, however improve wage outcomes, but only for those cohorts immediately impacted by the reform, and only in the medium run.},

Design: Interrupted time series analysis of observational primary care data of healthcare use in the Netherlands Main outcomes measures: Primary outcome was the change in consultation rate (consultations/1000 patients/month) before and after the release of the website. Additionally, a reference group was created by including consultations about topics not being viewed at the website. Subgroup analyses were performed for type of consultations, sex, age and socioeconomic status. Results: After launch of the website, the trend in consultation rate decreased with 1.620 consultations/ 1000 patients/month (p{\textless}0.001). This corresponds to a 12\% decline in consultations 2 years after launch of the website. The trend in consultation rate of the reference group showed no change. The subgroup analyses showed a specific decline for consultations by phone and were significant for all other subgroups, except for the youngest age group. Conclusions: Healthcare usage decreased by 12\% after providing high-quality evidence-based online health information.

Studies of former foster youth who aged out of care showed that these youth generally had poor employment outcomes in the period between ages 18 and 21. Using linked child welfare, wage and public assistance administrative data from three states (California, Minnesota and North Carolina), we investigated whether or not age-out youth continue to experience less employment and significantly lower earnings compared to their peers even into their mid-twenties in all three states and through the late twenties in North Carolina. The current study is the first to follow employment outcomes for age-out youth longitudinally up to age 30. We also assessed the significance of demographic, placement history and other factors on the employment and earnings of youth who aged out of foster care.Study findings showed that low rates of employment and earnings persisted for age-out youth compared to the low-income and national samples through age 24 in all three states and age 30 for North Carolina. Further, we found that work experience prior to age 18 improved employment outcomes in the mid to late twenties in all three states and longer stays in care improved employment outcomes in two of the study states. The primary implication of the study is that former foster youth need assistance well into adulthood. Federal and state initiatives have focused on extending foster care to age 21.

METHOD: Violence exposure and distress symptoms were evaluated in interviews, conducted between July 1996 and March 1998, of 300 children from Los Angeles County living in out-of-home placement.  RESULTS: Interviews were successfully completed in 91\% of eligible children. The majority of children (85\%) reported having been a witness to violence, and 51\% had been a victim of violence during their lifetime. Of these youths, 54\% and 41\%, respectively, reported having been exposed to such violence in the past 6 months. Girls, victims of assaultive violence and weapon related violence, and those reporting exposure to mild violence were more likely (p {\textless} .05) to have higher levels of distress symptoms than those without such characteristics, after age was controlled for.  CONCLUSIONS: Children in foster care continue to have high levels of violence exposure, even after removal from their biological parents' home.

	abstract = {Research indicates that foster youth tend to fare poorly in a number of domains in the transition to adulthood, and the shift to independent living may be particularly challenging. However, it is unclear whether negative housing outcomes are attributable to foster care history or if they are due to other risk factors. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to compare housing outcomes for foster youth to a matched sample of youth who share similar risk factors and to an unmatched sample. Results indicate that foster youth struggle more in the transition to independent living in comparison to both groups, showing higher rates of homelessness, less housing stability, poorer neighborhood quality, and more reliance on public housing assistance. The paper explores how factors related to foster care and confounding risk factors that tend to have higher prevalence among foster youth may contribute to these outcomes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article interrogates formal public evaluations of these extended care programmes with a particular focus on their eligibility criteria that have determined which groups of care leavers are included or alternatively excluded and the identified strengths and limitations of the programmes. Additionally, we consider cross-cultural differences in leaving care populations and variations within the broader social policy context of these jurisdictions, which may also impact on the effectiveness of policy transfer.

	title = {Youth transitioning from foster care: {Background} and federal programs},
	abstract = {While many young people have access to emotional and financial support systems throughout their early adult years, older youth in foster care and those who are emancipated from care often face obstacles to developing independent living skills and building supports that ease the transition to adulthood. Older foster youth who return to their parents or guardians may continue to experience poor family dynamics or lack supports, and studies have shown that recently emancipated foster youth fare poorly relative to their counterparts in the general population on several outcome measures. The federal government recognizes that older youth in foster care and those aging out are vulnerable to negative outcomes and may ultimately return to the care of the state as adults, either through the public welfare, criminal justice, or other systems. Under the federal foster care program, states may seek reimbursement for youth to remain in care up to the age of 21. In addition, the federal foster care program has certain protections for older youth. For example, states must annually obtain the credit report of each child in care who is age 14 and older. States must also assist youth with developing what is known as a transition plan. The law requires that a youth's caseworker, and as appropriate, other representative(s) of the youth, assist and support him or her in developing the plan. The plan is to be directed by the youth, and is to include specific options on housing, health insurance, education, local opportunities for mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. Other protections require states to ensure that youth age 14 and older are consulted about the development and revisions to their case plan and permanency plan, and that the case plan includes a document listing certain rights for these youth. Separately, the federal government provides funding for services to assist in the transition to adulthood through the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP). The law enables states to provide these services to youth who are (1) likely to age out of foster care (with no lower age limit), (2) youth who age out of care, and (3) youth age 16 or older who left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption. Independent living services may include assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, and preventive health activities, among other services. The CFCIP requires that states ensure youth in independent living programs participate directly in designing their own program activities that prepare them for independent living, and further that they "accept personal responsibility for living up to their part of the program." The Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) program separately authorizes discretionary funding for education and training vouchers for Chafee-eligible youth to cover their cost of postsecondary education (until age 23). A recent evaluation of independent living programs, such as those that provide mentoring and life skills, shows mixed results. One promising independent living program has social workers who oversee a small caseload and have regular, ongoing interactions with the youth. The youth in this program are more likely to attend college and stay enrolled than their peers not in the program. Along with the CFCIP, other federal programs are intended to help current and former youth in foster care make the transition to adulthood. Federal law authorizes funding for states and local jurisdictions to provide workforce support and housing to older foster youth and youth emancipating from care. Further, the law that established the CFCIP created an optional Medicaid eligibility pathway for youth who age out of foster care; this pathway is often called the "Chafee option." Beginning on January 1, 2014, eligible young people who were in foster care at age 18 are covered under a mandatory Medicaid pathway until age 26. In addition, youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth are specifically eligible for certain education and other services.},

The enduring presence of a caring adult, such as a natural mentor, can improve outcomes for emancipating foster youth.

Our aims were to test the feasibility of implementing C.A.R.E. and the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled study with older foster youth. Twenty-four foster youth aged 18–20.5 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 12) or control groups (n = 12). Ten natural mentors were identified and contacted for participation in the intervention and study. Process-oriented qualitative data and quantitative pre- and postintervention outcome data were collected and analyzed. Utilizing a controlled rigorous design, the findings highlight the positive experience of both the intervention youth and their natural mentors with C.A.R.E. Overall, results support the continued refinement, delivery, and rigorous testing of C.A.R.E. with great promise for programmatically supporting natural mentor relationships among youth aging out of foster care.},

	abstract = {Transition-aged foster care youth have higher risks of adverse outcomes, notably in education and employment, than youth who do not spend time in foster care. For the purpose of assisting a successful transition of foster care youth to adulthood, states provide Independent Living Services (ILS) with federal funding support. This study aims to test ILS's effects on educational attainment and employment of foster care youth. We employ multi-state data sources: the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Outcome survey, NYTD service files, and the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, collected from foster youth (N = 4206). The dependent variables are high school completion, post-secondary education, and full-time employment measured at age 21. The independent variable is any ILS use in the following areas during the ages of 17–18: academic support, career preparation, employment or vocational training, mentoring, or education financial assistance. Propensity Score Matching was used to adjust for potential selection bias and pre-existing differences in observation data between youth who received and did not receive ILS. The weighted logistic regression analyses show that foster youth using ILS are significantly more likely to complete high school education (Odds Ratio = 1.25, p =.03), have a post-secondary education (Odds Ratio = 1.20, p =.03), and work full-time (Odds Ratio = 1.24, p =.04) in emerging adulthood. We discuss the gaps and challenges in current research that estimates ILS effects. The findings suggest that it is critical to fully implement these services, explore approaches for providing more complete and equitable access, and continue work that further explicates key factors in receipt and effectiveness of ILS for transition-aged youth.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As teens in foster care prepare for emancipation, health care navigation is often overlooked, as caseworkers address other social needs. This study examined the impact of health care education materials designed for foster youth, called ICare2CHECK. It was hypothesized that ICare2CHECK would increase nonurgent ambulatory health care use and decrease emergency/urgent care use. Methods: Adolescents (N = 151; aged 16–22 years) were enrolled in ICare2CHECK and received health education materials at their baseline study visit. Surveys were repeated every 3 months to assess health care utilization. After 12 months of enrollment, health care data for all eligible youth and matched comparison youth (N = 151) over the previous 24 months were extracted from the electronic health record (N = 302). Electronic health record data were coded as counts of completed nonurgent ambulatory care encounters (i.e., primary and preventative care and specialty care), completed urgent or emergency encounters (i.e., urgent and emergency department visits and hospitalizations), completed foster care clinic visits, and total completed visits. Results: Health care use significantly decreased over time for both enrolled and comparison youth. Females, youth engaging in health risk behaviors, and those with a mental health or chronic condition diagnosis used significantly more health care. Receipt of educational materials was associated with a smaller decline in health care use and nonurgent ambulatory care use, controlling for covariates. Self-reported use of educational materials was associated with increased utilization in the enrolled condition. Conclusions: Results suggest that ICare2CHECK is associated with increased engagement in health care generally and nonurgent ambulatory care specifically (e.g., outpatient primary and specialty care).},

We measured housing stability using sequence analysis and assessed whether a supportive housing program in New York, New York, was effective in improving housing stability and reducing STIs among former foster youth. Matched administrative records identified 895 former foster youth who were eligible for the housing program during 2007-2010. The main outcomes included housing stability (as determined from episodes of homelessness, incarceration, hospitalization, and residence in supportive housing) and diagnosed STI case rates per 1,000 person-years during the 2 years after baseline. Marginal structural models were used to assess impacts of the program on these outcomes. Three housing stability patterns (unstable housing, stable housing, and rare institutional dwelling patterns) were identified. The housing program was positively associated with a pattern of stable housing (odds ratio = 4.4, 95\% confidence interval: 2.9, 6.8), and negatively associated with diagnosed STI rates (relative risk = 0.3, 95\% confidence interval: 0.2, 0.7). These positive impacts on housing stability and STIs highlight the importance of the supportive housing program for youths aging out of foster care and the need for such programs to continue.},

	abstract = {Youth aging out the child welfare system are being transitioned out of the child welfare system with few interventions in place to support their move to independence. In developed countries, compared to their peers, youth aging out of care face poorer outcomes when it comes to education, employment, and housing. A better understanding of the effectiveness of the existing interventions that support youth in care is warranted. This paper presents a critical scoping review of the available evidence on interventions available to youth who are aging out of the child welfare system and identifies gaps for future research. Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping reviews shaped the process of this review. A total of thirteen databases were searched resulting in the retrieval of 1978 articles. Of the 1978 retrieved, only 68 met the review's criteria. Studies included were in English, described an intervention that was implemented and evaluated in developed countries, and published within the last 20 years. Interventions were categorized as: housing, employment, education, mentorship, independent living, and health. The majority of studies fell under the independent living category which provide cohesive resources to improve education, housing, and employment. Studies evaluating these programs generally reported positive outcomes on youth's ability to complete their education and attain part- or full-time employment. Methods of evaluations were found to be methodologically weak with respect to determining the effectiveness of interventions in ensuring youth's successful transitions to independence. Future research should look at longitudinal outcomes of youth and cost-benefit analysis of supporting youth transitioning out of the child welfare system. Recommendations also include policy changes extending the age of eligibility for youth transitioning out of the child welfare system.},

	abstract = {Multi-dimensional social support is an important factor in any positive transition into young adulthood, and youth who are exiting foster care ideally receive comprehensive social support from a range of informal and formal sources. Yet the social networks of transition-age foster youth are likely influenced over time by child welfare involvement, which can weaken or disrupt natural support relationships, while introducing service-oriented relationships that are not intended to last into adulthood. To better understand the social support context of youth aging out of care, we can apply social network theory and methods to systematically identify their networks of supportive relationships and explore support provision as a network-based indicator. This paper presents a methodological approach to measure foster youth support networks, and describes these networks in terms of their capacity to provide support as a function of size, composition, and density, and in terms of actual support provision through identified relationships. Such a measurement approach should be systematic and reliable over time, and capture social support constructs relevant to practice with this population; preliminary inter-item and test-retest consistency findings are promising, and the method demonstrates construct and predictive validity in comparison with a measure of perceived availability of social support.},

We employed multilevel longitudinal modeling to estimate growth in social support over three time points (baseline, first follow-up, and second follow-up) among 482 youth (n = 234 LST; n = 248 control). We found a significant reduction in social support across the three time points. But, there was no difference in the social support trajectory between the LST and control groups. In addition, no racial/ethnic difference in the social support trajectory was detected. Results underscore the need to critically examine how independent living programming is intended to increase social support and whether modifying these practices can improve promotion and maintenance of social support for youth who age out of foster care.},

The present study included a diverse group of 99 young adults, who recently emancipated from care in a major U.S. city. These young adults reported having a very important non-parental adult (VIP) and 63 of these VIPs were also included in this study. The youth participated in a two-hour in-person interview followed by a survey, and the VIPs underwent a phone interview; all of these interviews were later transcribed and qualitatively coded using thematic analysis. Overall, this study aimed to: 1) identify the characteristics of these VIPs, and 2) elucidate how the VIPs support youth during the transition from care. Prominent characteristics of the youth and VIP relationship identified in this study include the relationship being “parent-like”, respectful, and reciprocal with regards to communication. Moreover, it was found that both the youth and the VIPs viewed these relationships to be important in reducing negative outcomes for the youth. These results call for the foster care system to take steps in helping foster care youth find and build relationships with the non-parental adults in their lives — VIPs can serve as important sources of support to aid foster youth in their adaptation to young adulthood.},

Searches of health, social science and social care bibliographic databases were conducted and records were screened for relevance. Citation and reference list searches were conducted on included studies. Relevant studies were synthesized and critically appraised. Seven studies were identified (five retrospective and two prospective cohort studies), six of which were conducted in the USA and one in the UK. Overall, LAYP who received TSSs were more likely to complete compulsory education with formal qualifications, be in current employment, be living independently and less likely to be young parents. There was no reported effect of the impact of TSSs on crime or mental health, and mixed findings for homelessness. The range of TSS components investigated and reported varied considerably within and between studies, with limited evidence of long-term outcomes. The literature reviewed offers no reliable conclusions on the effectiveness of TSSs at this time due to variations in research quality and because few formal evaluations of existing TSSs have been conducted, resulting in mixed evidence in terms of positive, negative and neutral impact on outcomes. Further high-quality, robust research to evaluate the effectiveness of TSSs on adult outcomes for young people in the short, medium and longer term is needed to address the health inequalities experienced by this small but vulnerable group and to inform decision making about service provision. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: The 1999 John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Act expanded a federal funding stream for independent living/transition services for older youth (ages 14+) in and transitioning from foster care. As a result, there has been a proliferation of programs that target youth who are likely to age out of foster care with the intention of improving their emerging adulthood outcomes. These programs aim to improve wellbeing outcomes related to education, employment, housing, health/mental health, and relationships. Using a scoping review framework, we sought to take stock of the state of the science of the programs and interventions (PIs) currently available for young people who age out of foster care. We offer research recommendations regarding how the field can move forward with promoting improved wellbeing of young people in care as they transition to adulthood. We assess to what extent both services for young people aging out of care and related research has included vulnerable populations, including pregnant/parenting youth, LGBTQ + youth, youth of color, youth with disabilities, and crossover youth. Method: Using the National Governors Association's Center for Best Practices (2010) as a guide, we searched the research and gray literatures for PIs that target education, employment, housing, health/mental health, and relationships. Then, we searched the research and gray literatures for evidence of effectiveness in the form of peer-reviewed scientific articles and evaluation reports. Next, based on the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse (CEBC) for Child Welfare's Scientific Rating Scale, we assigned each PI a rating (1 = Well-Supported by Research Evidence, 2 = Supported by Research Evidence, 3 = Promising Research Evidence, 4 = Failure to Demonstrate Effect, and 5 = Concerning Practice). Findings: Of the 79 PIs we found, 10 (13\%) yielded a rating from 1 to 5. The best rating in any of the five practice areas was a 2 (“Supported by Research Evidence”), which applied to four programs. The area with the most rated programs was relationships, with four programs receiving a rating. The area with the least PIs was health/mental health care, with only a single program receiving a rating. Regarding vulnerable populations, 64 programs targeted at least one of the vulnerable populations of interest; 10 (16\%) were rated with the CEBC Scale. Implications: When the Foster Care Independence Act was passed, there was a dearth of PIs that targeted the wellbeing of older youth in foster care who were likely to age out. In the last 20 years, we have done an excellent job developing PIs. Given the results of this scoping review, we must now build the evidence for the PIs that already exist. This process entails ensuring agencies are equipped with the capacities to implement PIs to fidelity and that procedures are in place to examine the effectiveness for the many PIs that are already being delivered to marginalized young people who age out of care. Special attention should also be devoted to testing the efficacy and effectiveness of existing PIs for vulnerable populations, as their experiences have not been adequately illuminated by previous research.},

Various structured programs and additional support exist to help them make this transition and these provide help before or after they have left care. However, the outcomes of such support programs are fragmented. The aim of this study was to synthesize the empirical evidence of studies that evaluated additional support programs that facilitated the transition of care leavers to adulthood. Eligibility criteria: Six databases were searched that were published in English in peer-review journals from 2010 to 2019. We reviewed 16 studies related to additional support programs with different methodological designs. Sample: Care leavers' who have left the foster care. Results: There were two different types of programs: single-focused and multiple-focused programs. Half of them provided holistic support. Feedback from care leavers provided practical suggestions for the development of relationships with the staffs and peers, for the development of programs and care leavers own involvement in decision-making. The evaluations showed weak evidence of the effectiveness of housing, employment and educational programs. Conclusions: The programs were poorly described and heterogenous so that the outcomes could not be compared. It was not possible to provide robust information about their effectiveness. Implications: We need holistic programs which consider care leavers needs and views, and evaluate rigorously the programs by strong study designs, to determine their effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Each year tens of millions of federal dollars are invested to promote secondary and postsecondary educational attainment among older youth in foster care. Despite the presumption that this is a sound investment, as indicated by copious research from studies of the general U.S. population, research examining the payoff among youth transitioning to adulthood from state care has been sparse. In the present study, we analyze the relationship between educational attainment and employment outcomes among youth exiting care. Drawing on data from a large, multi-state study of youth transitioning from foster care, findings indicate that increased education, and particularly degree completion, is associated with greater earnings and lower employment rates. Compared to young adults matched on educational attainment from a nationally representative study, youth formerly in foster care earn about half and the employment rate is 20 points lower. However, increased levels of education have larger benefits for youth who exited care than youth from the general population, and at higher levels of attainment the two groups have similar employment rates and earnings gaps become less pronounced. Among youth formerly in care, results from regression analyses indicate that, compared to individuals with no high school credential, a GED or certificate of completion predicts no benefits in earnings or likelihood of being employed; a diploma predicts an earnings benefit; and some college, a two-year degree, and a four-year degree or greater predict large benefits in earnings and likelihood of employment. We conclude by briefly discussing implications for policy, practice, and future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Papers were included if they assessed the extent to which transitional support interventions, delivered in Australia, improved housing, employment, education, financial, health, or social functioning outcomes. Eleven studies were included. Interventions primarily adopted a case management approach to support care-leavers’ transition. Interventions facilitated improvements in care-leavers’ independent living outcomes (e.g., housing, education, and financial stability), but less so in health outcomes.

Given enhanced self-determination has been associated with improved transition outcomes for youth in special education, the purpose of this longitudinal, randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy of the TAKE CHARGE self-determination intervention for improving the transition outcomes of those highly at-risk youth who are in both foster care and special education. The intervention included coaching for youth in the application of self-determination skills to achieve youth-identified goals, and youth participation in mentoring workshops with near peer foster care alumni. Sixty-nine youth, ages 16.5 to 17.5, were randomly assigned to TAKE CHARGE or to the foster care independent living program. Assessment at baseline, post-intervention and at one year follow-up revealed moderate to large effect sizes at post-intervention and one year follow-up for the differences between groups in self-determination, quality of life, and utilization of community transition services. Youth in the intervention group also completed high school, were employed, and carried out independent living activities at notably higher rates than the comparison group. Self-determination was confirmed as a partial mediator of enhanced quality of life.

A nationally representative sample of adolescents investigated by the child welfare system in 2008 to 2009 from the second cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being Study (NSCAW II) reported experiences of housing problems at 18- and 36-month follow-ups. Latent class analyses identified subtypes of housing problems, including literal homelessness, housing instability, and stable housing. Regressions predicted subgroup membership based on aging out experiences, receipt of foster care services, and youth and county characteristics. Youth who reunified after out-of-home placement in adolescence exhibited the lowest probability of literal homelessness, while youth who aged out experienced similar rates of literal homelessness as youth investigated by child welfare but never placed out of home. No differences existed between groups on prevalence of unstable housing. Exposure to independent living services and extended foster care did not relate with homelessness prevention. Findings emphasize the developmental importance of families in promoting housing stability in the transition to adulthood, while questioning child welfare current focus on preparing foster youth to live.},

	abstract = {Research has demonstrated the employment and earnings benefits accompanying educational attainment, and the relatively poor educational attainment and economic well-being of young people who transition to adulthood from foster care. Policymakers’ concern over these poor outcomes has long been reflected in U.S. child welfare policy, most recently in the provisions of the 2008 Fostering Connections to Success Act allowing states to claim federal reimbursement for extending foster care from age 18 to age 21. While the policy of allowing youth to remain in foster care past age 18 has promise as a strategy for helping them continue their education, empirical evidence of its impact is lacking. Using data from a longitudinal study of youth (n = 732) who transitioned to adulthood from foster care, this study takes advantage of between-state policy variation in the age at which youth are required to leave care to assess the relationship between extended foster care and educational attainment at age 26. Distinguishing between not having obtained a high school diploma or GED, having only a high school diploma or GED, and having obtained at least one year of college, each additional year in care is associated with a 46\% increase in the estimated odds that former foster youth will progress to the next level of educational attainment, controlling for a range of youth characteristics measured at ages 17–18. Background characteristics including youth's gender, race, employment, parenting, educational performance and aspirations, and indicators of behavioral health problems are also associated with educational attainment in early adulthood.},

Youth who were parents, who had recently experienced housing instability, or who were African American had approximately twice the odds of experiencing homelessness in the year after exiting foster care. In addition, youth who had experienced disrupted adoptions, had multiple foster care placements (especially in congregate care settings), or had been involved with the juvenile justice system were more likely to become homeless.

Youths aging out of foster care are at high risk for becoming homeless during the transition to adulthood. Between 31\% and 46\% of our study participants had been homeless at least once by age 26 years. Running away while in foster care, greater placement instability, being male, having a history of physical abuse, engaging in more delinquent behaviors, and having symptoms of a mental health disorder were associated with an increase in the relative risk of becoming homeless.

	abstract = {Young people who are taken up into the care system (including foster, formal kinship and residential or group care) traditionally have to leave care at age 18, the generally accepted age of adulthood. Research globally has shown that most youth are not ready to transition to independent living at 18 and require additional support into early adulthood. One specific type of support that has gained increasing interest is extended care arrangements, including permitting young people to remain in their care placements beyond the age of 18. While widely discussed, there is a limited body of literature on the conceptualisation, implementation and evaluation of extended care, and almost no cross-national dialogue on extended care. This article aims to gather together a range of experiences on extended care and to explore the extent to which there is a cross-national consensus on the conceptualisation and operationalisation of extended care. Ten countries participated in the study, reviewing their country's extended care policy, practice and research using a common matrix. Findings reveal adoption of aspects of extended care in all countries, wide variations in how extended care is conceptualised, legislated, funded and implemented, and very little research on the effectiveness of extended care. The authors recommend resolving cross-national variations in the conceptualisation of extended care and further research on the role and contribution of extended care placements to improved outcomes for youth in diverse social, political and economic contexts.},

	abstract = {Background: Relative to their counterparts in the general population, young people who leave, or transition out of, out-of-home (OOHC) arrangements commonly experience poorer outcomes across a range of indicators, including higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, reliance on public assistance, physical and mental health problems and contact with the criminal justice system. The age at which young people transition from OOHC varies between and within some countries, but for most, formal support ceases between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs designed to support transitions are generally available to young people toward the end of their OOHC placement, although some can extend beyond. They often encourage the development of skills required for continued engagement in education, obtaining employment, maintaining housing and general life skills. Little is known about the effectiveness of these programs or of extended care policies that raise the age at which support remains available to young people after leaving OOHC. This systematic review will seek to identify programs and/or interventions that improve outcomes for youth transitioning from the OOHC system into adult living arrangements. Methods: This review will identify programs, interventions and policies that seek to improve health and wellbeing of this population that have been tested using robust controlled methods. Primary outcomes of interest are homelessness, health, education, employment, exposure to violence and risky behaviour. Secondary outcomes are relationships and life skills. We will search, from January 1990 onwards, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment. Grey literature will be identified through searching websites and databases, e.g. clearing houses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research on this topic area. Two reviewers will independently screen all title and abstracts and full text articles with conflicts to be resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be undertaken by pairs of review authors, with one reviewer checking the results of the other. If more than one study with suitable data can be identified, we plan to undertake both fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses and intend to present the random-effects result if there is no indication of funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias will be assessed using tools appropriate to the study methodology. Quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Discussion: Previous reviews were unable to identify any programs or interventions, backed by methodologically rigorous research, that improve outcomes for this population. This review seeks to update this previous work, taking into account changes in the provision of extended care, which is now available in some jurisdictions.

Yet, the literature searching component of systematic reviews and related review types is often poorly reported. Guidance for literature search reporting has been diverse, and, in many cases, does not offer enough detail to authors who need more specific information about reporting search methods and information sources in a clear, reproducible way. This document presents the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension) checklist, and explanation and elaboration.
Methods: The checklist was developed using a 3-stage Delphi survey process, followed by a consensus conference and public review process.
Results: The final checklist includes 16 reporting items, each of which is detailed with exemplar reporting and rationale.
Conclusions: The intent of PRISMA-S is to complement the PRISMA Statement and its extensions by providing a checklist that could be used by interdisciplinary authors, editors, and peer reviewers to verify that each component of a search is completely reported and therefore reproducible.},

	abstract = {Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29\% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19\% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion.},

	abstract = {The Youth Villages Transitional Living program is intended to help youth who were formerly in foster care or juvenile justice custody, or who are otherwise unprepared for adult life, to make the transition to independent living. Youth Villages, which serves emotionally and behaviorally troubled young people, operates a number of programs in addition to Transitional Living. All of its programs are based on a set of core principles that emphasize treatment planning, systematic assessment of participating youth, and delivery of only evidence-informed practices within a highly structured supervisory system. Transitional Living clients receive intensive, individualized, and clinically focused and community-based case management, support, and counseling from staff who carry caseloads of about eight clients each. Youth eligibility is determined through an extensive recruitment and assessment process. Once youth are enrolled, Transitional Living staff continue to assess them to identify needs and work with them to develop goals, which become the basis of required weekly meetings. Over nine months, on average, program participants get support for education, housing, mental or physical health, employment, and life skills. This support is provided in a variety of forms, including action-oriented activities that involve completing a specific task during a weekly session or through more traditional counseling techniques. The Transitional Living Evaluation is focused exclusively on the program in Tennessee, although Youth Villages also has Transitional Living programs in six other states. Key Findings include: (1) Variation in the local context across Tennessee shaped the experiences of youth who participated in the evaluation. Resources that can be limited or challenging to navigate, particularly in rural areas, include access to transportation, employers, and social service providers. (2) Staff interviews and analysis of the management information system indicated that the Transitional Living program was implemented in accordance with the program model, with the frequency and duration of Transitional Living services close to expected levels. (3) Participation levels in the Transitional Living program were high, and youth were engaged in services soon after being assigned to receive them. Staff discussed a wide range of topics with their cases and made contact with other adults who were involved in each youth's life. A sample treatment plan is provided in the appendix.},

Findings show that between one-quarter and one-third of youth and young adults experiencing homelessness had a history of foster care. The findings also reveal that young people's entry into foster care was often part of a larger pattern of family instability and was perceived by some young people as the beginning of their experience with homelessness. The research shows that there are multiple pathways to homelessness from foster care.},

	abstract = {The economic benefits of a college education are well documented; however, data from studies of young people transitioning out of foster care indicate that the college graduation rate for this population is very low. The child welfare system has traditionally done a poor job of encouraging foster youth to pursue postsecondary education. Although addressing the financial barrier to postsecondary education is critical, and may make college a more economically viable option, most current programs do not address this population's nonfinancial needs. One exception in this area is the growing number of campus support programs for young people making the transition out of foster care. Although each program is unique, they typically provide an array of financial, academic, social/emotional, and logistical supports to help former foster youth stay in school and graduate. They are currently concentrated in California or Washington State and are supported, at least in part, by private philanthropy. This study included two components: telephone interviews with program directors and a Web-based survey of current program participants, and indicates a need for a comprehensive impact or summative evaluation of campus support programs. Such an evaluation is recommended to examine whether these programs lead to better educational outcomes, as measured by higher college retention and graduation rates, and to investigate how the relationship between program participation and educational outcomes varies depending on the characteristics of the former foster youth, the types of services and supports that students receive, and the institutional setting. Possible leveraging resources for such a study are also discussed. An appendix includes the Program Director Interview Protocol, Web-Based Survey Instrument, and Responses to Survey Questions by Campus Support Program. (Contains 24 tables and 28 footnotes.)},

	abstract = {Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1\% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for "just-in-time" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior. © 2014 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the X2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Research conducted prior to the passage of the Fostering Connections Act provided early evidence on the impact of extended foster care (EFC) on youth outcomes, finding that time in EFC promoted educational attainment, increased earnings, and decreased instances of homelessness and criminal justice involvement (see, e.g., Courtney \& Hook, 2017; Dworsky, Napolitano, \& Courtney, 2013; Hook \& Courtney, 2011; Lee, Courtney, \& Tajima, 2014). An earlier report from the ongoing California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study (CalYOUTH) found EFC to be associated with improved educational attainment, increased financial assets, reduced receipt of need-based public aid, and decreased homelessness, economic hardship, and criminal justice system involvement (Courtney \& Okpych, 2017). The present report builds on that prior research by examining outcomes from the third interview wave of CalYOUTH, which took place when study participants were 21 years old or older.},

	abstract = {Many interventions found to be effective in health services research studies fail to translate into meaningful patient care outcomes across multiple contexts. Health services researchers recognize the need to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination into other settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help promote effective implementation. However, they overlap considerably in the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research (CFIR) that offers an overarching typology to promote implementation theory development and verification about what works where and why across multiple contexts. We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on strength of conceptual or empirical support for influence on implementation, consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and potential for measurement. We combined constructs across published theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapping in definition, and we parsed apart constructs that conflated underlying concepts. The CFIR is composed of five major domains: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the process of implementation. Eight constructs were identified related to the intervention (e.g., evidence strength and quality), four constructs were identified related to outer setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were identified related to inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership engagement), five constructs were identified related to individual characteristics, and eight constructs were identified related to process (e.g., plan, evaluate, and reflect). We present explicit definitions for each construct. The CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for approaching complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of constructs in the real world by embracing, consolidating, and unifying key constructs from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide formative evaluations and build the implement…},

The analysis using a general inductive approach showed that their expectations were dependent on the time horizon and that there was an obvious difference between the young informants' short- and long-term expectations. Their short-term expectations consisted of worries connected to their approaching discharge (at T1) and how to cope with challenges of everyday life after discharge from care (at T2). These results seem to echo negative outcomes shown in previous quantitative research. However, the informants' long-term expectations provide a different picture, being mainly positive in both interviews (T1 and T2). The results are discussed from a life course perspective, where the informants' visions of their future are framed and understood in terms of the different stages of their transition process.},

Mobile interventions have shown efficacy for several mental and physical health issues and may be helpful in overcoming barriers facing foster youth with substance use problems. A program (iHeLP) for substance use reduction was developed that used a computerized screening and brief intervention (SBI) followed by six months of dynamically-tailored text messages. The program was shown to focus groups of youth (N = 24) ages 18–19 who recently left foster care and had moderate to severe substance use risk. Focus group feedback was used to modify iHeLP prior to delivery in an open trial (N = 16). Both study phases included assessments of feasibility and acceptability; the open trial also included assessments of substance use outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Focus groups indicated a high level of acceptability for the proposed intervention components. Of those screened for the open trial, 43\% were eligible and 74\% of those eligible enrolled, indicating good feasibility. Retention through the final follow-up was 59\%, and drop out was associated with involvement in the criminal justice system. Participant ratings for liking, ease of working with, interest in and respectfulness of the SBI were high. Satisfaction ratings for the texting component were also high. A computerized brief screening intervention for substance use risk reduction together with tailored text messaging is both feasible and highly acceptable among youth who have recently aged-out of foster care.},

The research compared housing, child welfare and public assistance outcomes for the treatment (N = 90) and control (N = 73) groups, explored how the program delivered its services, the service pattern over time, and perspectives of child welfare and program staff. We found that during and in the year after exiting the program, treatment group clients were less likely to use homeless services and were more likely to access public assistance benefits as compared with the control group clients, and during and after the program, the treatment and control group clients’ child maltreatment reports were not statistically significantly different. There were positive indications from quantitative data showing that the intervention patterns align with those of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), with qualitative interview data indicating shifts over time in case management focus from short-term crisis management and housing stability toward working on longer-term independent living skills. The findings contribute to the literature regarding how best to serve homeless, child welfare-involved families, and suggest the necessity for longer-term interventions and greater attention to non-housing-related needs.},

The first phase of this evaluation was completed in August 1990. This report addresses the findings of Phase II conducted between August 1990 and September 1991. The sample design for this study employed a multi-stage, stratified design with probability sampling at each of three stages of selection: State, county clusters, and youth 16 and older who were discharged from foster care. Using regression modeling techniques, the impact of receiving independent living skills training on these youths' outcomes was assessed. The ability to achieve self-sufficiency was measured in the near term and the long term. The study found: (1) services authorized by the Independent Living Initiatives have the potential to improve outcomes for youth; (2) skills training in particular skill areas led to better individual outcomes and no one skill area had a consistent effect across all outcomes assessed; and (3) more comprehensive effects were achieved with a combination of skills delivered within a prescribed set of five skill areas: money management, consumer skills, skill in obtaining credit, skill in the use of educational opportunities, and skill in finding and maintaining employment.

It is a collaborative effort involving Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago; the University of Wisconsin Survey Center; and the public child welfare agencies in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Study provides a comprehensive picture of how foster youth are faring during this transition since the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 became law. Foster youth in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois were eligible to participate in the study if they had entered care before their 16th birthday, were still in care at age 17, and had been removed from home for reasons other than delinquency. Baseline survey data were collected from 732 study participants when they were 17 or 18 years old. Study participants were re-interviewed at ages 19 (n = 603), 21 (n = 591), 23 or 24 (n = 602), and 26 (n = 596). Because many of the questions Midwest Study participants were also asked as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, it is possible to make comparisons between this sample of former foster youth and a nationally representative sample of young people in the general population. These comparisons indicate that young people who have aged out of foster care are faring poorly as a group relative to their peers across a variety of domains. The Midwest Study also presents a unique opportunity to compare the outcomes of young people from one state (i.e., Illinois) that allows foster youth to remain in care until their 21st birthday to the outcomes of young people from two other states (i.e., Iowa and Wisconsin) in which foster youth generally age out when they are 18 years old. The data suggest that extending foster care until age 21 may be associated with better outcomes, at least in some domains.},

The Midwest Study provides a comprehensive picture of how foster youth are faring during this transition since the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 became law. Foster youth in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois were eligible to participate in the study if they had entered care before their 16th birthday, were still in care at age 17, and had been removed from home for reasons other than delinquency. Baseline survey data were collected from 732 study participants when they were 17 or 18 years old. Study participants were re-interviewed at ages 19 (n = 603), 21 (n = 591), 23 or 24 (n = 602), and 26 (n = 596). Because many of the questions Midwest Study participants were also asked as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, it is possible to make comparisons between this sample of former foster youth and a nationally representative sample of young people in the general population. These comparisons indicate that young people who have aged out of foster care are faring poorly as a group relative to their peers across a variety of domains. The Midwest Study also presents a unique opportunity to compare the outcomes of young people from one state (i.e., Illinois) that allows foster youth to remain in care until their 21st birthday to the outcomes of young people from two other states (i.e., Iowa and Wisconsin) in which foster youth generally age out when they are 18 years old. The data suggest that extending foster care until age 21 may be associated with better outcomes, at least in some domains.},

It also explores how allowing young people to remain in foster care until age twenty-one affects their health insurance coverage, use of family planning services, and information about birth control. We find that young women are more likely to have health insurance if they remain in foster care until their twenty-first birthday and that having health insurance is associated with an increase in the likelihood of receiving family planning services. Our results also suggest that many young women who would otherwise lack health insurance after aging out of foster care will be eligible for Medicaid under the health care reform law. Because having health insurance is associated with use of family planning services, this increase in Medicaid eligibility may result in fewer unintended pregnancies among this high-risk population. © 2013 by Duke University Press.},

	abstract = {Building an evidence base for postsecondary education programs for young people transitioning out of foster care is more important than ever. Economic trends have made postsecondary education increasingly important to self-sufficiency, but research suggests that far too many young people in foster care will not have the educational credentials needed to succeed in this economy without additional supports. These young people need programs that will help close the gap in postsecondary educational attainment between them and their peers. Young people in foster care enroll in college at lower rates than their peers (Geiger and Beltran 2017) and are less likely to persist through the end of their first year when they do enroll (California College Pathways 2015; Day et al. 2011; Frerer, Sosenko, and Henke 2013). For example, one study of young people transitioning out of foster care in three Midwest states found that only 24 percent were enrolled in college at age 19 compared with 55 percent of 19-year-olds in a nationally representative sample (Courtney et al. 2007). That study also found that only 47 percent of young people in foster care who had enrolled in college by their mid-20s persisted through their first two semesters compared with 77 percent of a nationally representative sample of first-generation college students with low incomes (Okpych and Courtney 2019). To address this educational attainment gap, a provision in the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 gave states the option to extend federally funded (Title IV-E) foster care up to age 21 for young people who meet certain eligibility criteria. One of those criteria is enrollment in a postsecondary education program.},

	abstract = {During emerging adulthood, most youth receive family support to help them weather the difficulties associated with transitioning to independence. When foster youth emancipate, they confront the challenges associated with emerging adulthood, and are at risk of having to transition without family support. Many are in danger of failing to meet minimal levels of self-sufficiency. A caring adult who offers social support is normative for adolescent development and protective for youth across many risk conditions. Natural mentoring can cultivate such relationships. This study examines the association between natural mentor relationship characteristics, and material hardship and asset-related outcomes during the emerging adulthood period in both a normative sample of young adults and young adults identified as former foster youth. This study also considers the potential mediating effect of future expectations. Data from Wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health that pertain to 15,197 respondents are used. Path models with categorical dependent variables were estimated using a maximum likelihood method with standard errors that are robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations. Like a parent , role model , and guidance/advice were significantly associated with assets among both groups. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on natural mentoring and former foster youth, and highlights the value of increasing our understanding of natural mentor roles for intervention development. The focus on asset-related outcomes is a novel approach to investigate the benefits of natural mentoring to the healthy development of youth. This paper is the first to consider the association between natural mentoring and asset building among both former and nonformer foster youth. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Out-of-home care (OoHC) refers to young people removed from their families by the state because of abuse, neglect or other adversities. Many of the young people experience poor mental health and social function before, during and after leaving care. Rigorously evaluated interventions are urgently required. This publication describes the protocol for the Ripple project and notes early findings from a controlled trial demonstrating the feasibility of the work. The Ripple project is implementing and evaluating a complex mental health intervention that aims to strengthen the therapeutic capacities of carers and case managers of young people (12-17 years) in OoHC. Methods: The study is conducted in partnership with mental health, substance abuse and social services in Melbourne, with young people as participants. It has three parts: 1. Needs assessment and implementation of a complex mental health intervention; 2. A 3-year controlled trial of the mental health, social and economic outcomes; and 3. Nested process evaluation of the intervention. Results: Early findings characterising the young people, their carers and case managers and implementing the intervention are available. The trial Wave 1 includes interviews with 176 young people, 52\% of those eligible in the study population, 104 carers and 79 case managers. Conclusions: Implementing and researching an affordable service system intervention appears feasible and likely to be applicable in other places and countries. Success of the intervention will potentially contribute to reducing mental ill-health among these young people, including suicide attempts, self-harm and substance abuse, as well as reducing homelessness, social isolation and contact with the criminal justice system.

Care leavers are seriously disadvantaged in the structure of the Australian housing market – public housing is hard to obtain and care leavers struggle to enter and remain in the private rental market. In depth interviews with 77 care leavers found that the majority of young people (59 of the 77) experienced a ‘volatile transition’ from care. They struggled to find and maintain appropriate housing with the result that chronic housing instability and homelessness were common outcomes. Half of these however, showed an improvement in their circumstances over time. The research found that the best opportunity to make a smooth transition to independent living rests on a joined up approach to transition planning that begins well before the age of 18, combined with readily available post-care support and assistance.},

This program was meant to provide an innovative long-term placement option for adolescent foster youth who did not have other placement options, and who would not likely return to their biological families. The program would provide a stable home and a comprehensive educational program in preparation for emancipation from the foster care system. Preliminary outcomes for the first three graduating classes are encouraging relative to other published reports of discharged foster youth. School completion and college attendance rates are higher than the rates reported in most other studies. However, non-college bound graduates on average are reporting low incomes and much flux in their housing and employment situations. Youth are also reporting higher rates of substance use than one would expect to find in the general population, but graduates are not reporting any of the criminal justice involvement or victimization found in other studies of discharged foster youth. These data suggest that residential education with supportive services providing placement stability may be a promising strategy for insuring school completion and more positive outcomes for foster youth. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Such problems in adolescence have long-lasting implications for subsequent adjustment throughout adulthood and even across generations. Although several programs have demonstrated positive results in reducing substance use in at-risk youth, few studies have systemically examined how such programs work for foster youth and whether they are effective for both genders. This study examined the efficacy of KEEP SAFE, a family-based and skill-focused program designed to prevent substance use and other related health risking behaviors among youth in foster care. We hypothesized that improving the caregiver–youth relationship would lead to later reductions in youths’ involvement with deviant peers, which subsequently would lead to less substance use, and that this mechanism would work comparably for both genders. A sample of 259 youth (154 girls, ages 11–17 years) in foster care and their caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial and was followed for 18 months post-baseline. Results indicated that the intervention significantly reduced substance use in foster youth at 18 months post-baseline and that the intervention influenced substance use through two processes: youths’ improved quality of relationships with caregivers at 6 months post-baseline and fewer associations with deviant peers at 12 months post-baseline. This suggests that these two processes may be fruitful immediate targets in substance use prevention programs for foster youth. We also found little gender differences in direct and mediating effects of the intervention, suggesting KEEP SAFE may be effective for both genders in foster care.},

Given a range of housing options at the time of discharge, over half (55\%) chose an independent living arrangement, including 41\% who lived in their own place, either alone (28\%) or with a roommate (13\%). Only 21\% decided to live in someone else's home, including just 7\% with one or both birth parents, 10\% with some other relative, and 4\% with a non-relative. The remaining 24\% of youth were discharged from independent living to a more restrictive living arrangement (a.k.a., higher "level of care", including a residential treatment program, group home, foster care, or supervised independent living program) (11\%) or whose whereabouts were unknown (13\%). The outcomes of this study suggest that, when presented with a choice of housing options, most of this county's emancipating foster youth would prefer to live on their own, rather than to return to live with their families of origin. The study also suggests that many youth who participate in a scattered-site housing-based independent living program can succeed in leaving care with affordable housing in place and avoid immediate homelessness. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Looked-after children (LAC) are at greater risk of teenage pregnancy than non-LAC, which is associated with adverse health and social consequences. Existing interventions have failed to reduce rates of teenage pregnancy in LAC. Peer mentoring is proposed as a means of addressing many of the factors associated with the increased risk of teenage pregnancy in this group. Objective: To develop a peer mentoring intervention to reduce teenage pregnancy in LAC. Design: Phase I and II randomised controlled trial of a peer mentoring intervention for LAC; scoping exercise and literature search; national surveys of social care professionals and LAC; and focus groups and interviews with social care professionals, mentors and mentees. Setting: Three local authorities (LAs) in England. Participants: LAC aged 14–18 years (mentees/care as usual) and 19–25 years (mentors). Intervention: Recruitment and training of mentors; randomisation and matching of mentors to mentees; and 1-year individual peer mentoring. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome: pregnancy in LAC aged 14–18 years. Secondary outcomes: sexual attitudes, behaviour and knowledge; psychological health; help-seeking behaviour; locus of control; and attachment style. A health economic evaluation was also carried out. Results: In total, 54\% of target recruitment was reached for the exploratory trial and 13 out of 20 mentors (65\%) and 19 out of 30 LAC aged 14–18 years (63\%) (recruited during Phases I and II) were retained in the research. The training programme was acceptable and could be manualised and replicated. Recruitment and retention difficulties were attributed to systemic problems and LA lack of research infrastructure and lack of additional funding to support and sustain such an intervention. Mentees appeared to value the intervention but had difficulty in meeting weekly as required. Only one in four of the relationships continued for the full year. A future Phase III trial would require the intervention to be modified to include provision of group and individual peer mentoring; internal management of the project, with support from an external agency such as a charity or the voluntary sector; funds to cover LA research costs, including the appointment of a dedicated project co-ordinator; a reduction in the lower age for mentee recruitment and an increase in the mentor recruitment age to 21 years; and the introduction of a more formal recruitment and support structure for mentors.

	abstract = {Housing stability is essential for young adult development. Older youth and young adults transitioning from public systems of care, such as foster care, the public mental health system and residential settings, commonly experience high levels of transience and housing instability. In recent years, supportive housing policies and programs have emerged to address this situation, yet we know little about whether (or not) new programs are meeting the needs of youth in transition, and, if so, how they are addressing the unique developmental, social, and emotional needs of this population. This study is one of the first to speak directly with young adults living in a supportive housing program designed specifically for youth transitioning out of children's systems of care. Study participants spoke about both their overall transition experience and their views on the housing program where they reside. The study conducted four focus groups (N=26) with transitioning youth and young adults, ages 18 to 25 (Mean age=22), in order to explore the following three broad research questions: 1) what is it like to make the transition to adulthood from public children's systems of care?; 2) how does the supportive housing model they reside in shape their transition experiences?; and, 3) how do they experience the services and staff who are part of the program? Data analysis included grounded theory coding techniques and constant comparison with four coders. Results suggest that participants feel like they continue to be treated as children, and they receive mixed messages regarding their need to be increasingly autonomous, yet follow the rules. Finally, they reported specific aspects of what they found to be helpful in both staff relationships and overall program components. These themes constitute the results of the study. Findings underscore the importance of both listening directly to service users, and developing young adult supportive housing programming expressly designed to meet the unique needs of marginalized young adults transitioning to increased independence and self-sufficiency.},

However, very little research has been conducted to specify or validate effective models for improving the transition trajectories of youth exiting care. Evidence suggests the My Life self-determination enhancement model offers a promising approach for supporting youths' self-determined and positive transition to adulthood. The model includes youth-directed, experientially oriented coaching in the application of self-determination skills to achieve youth-identified transition goals, coupled with peer mentoring workshops that provide opportunities for learning, networking and fun. This in depth qualitative study of 10 youth who completed the My Life intervention focused on investigating coaching and mentoring elements and processes that youth participants identify as most important to their success, with the intention of informing the further development of youth-directed approaches to supporting young people who are transitioning to adulthood. Themes emerged around the centrality of youth self-direction, important processes in the coaching relationship, the essential value of experiential activities and self-determination skill development, and peer mentoring experiences that youth identified as fostering their success. Implications are discussed for research and practice in supporting youth exiting foster care.},

The sample comprised 80 care leavers, and, for comparison, a group of 59 young people (termed ?in difficulty?) who met certain criteria of disadvantage. Care leavers were found to have fewer crisis transitions and less experience of homelessness, together with a much higher level of autonomy and support in their first accommodation, relative to other young people in difficulty. Several factors are identified that, from the care leavers' point of view, contributed to their better access and use of housing services, including having family and friends to turn to, and leaving care teams that negotiated on their behalf with housing services. The paper concludes that care leavers had more positive housing experiences than other young people in difficulty, helped by the improved preparation for independence and ongoing support available to them from leaving care teams.},

With career planning self-determination interventions, young adults with mental health challenges might be able to achieve better career and life outcomes than is typical for this population.},

Transition-age foster youth (TAY) experience at least double the rate of pregnancy compared to the general population, yet few researchers have investigated ways to improve the reproductive health of transition-age foster youth. We assessed feasibility and gathered preliminary outcomes data on use of the Making Proud Choices! For Youth in Out-of-Home Care (MPCOOH) curriculum for TAY in extended foster care in Los Angeles County. Of 79 MPCOOH workshop attendees, 72 attended 2 or more sessions, receiving at least half of the curriculum. Of those, 64 attendees provided valid contact information to participate in outcomes research, of whom 54 completed at least 2 of 3 surveys (pre, post, 3-month follow-up), and were thus included in analyses. Participants provided positive feedback after completing the curriculum. Findings showed a significant improvement in sexual and reproductive health knowledge, birth control familiarity, attitudes, and self-efficacy, post-intervention. We demonstrated the feasibility of MPCOOH delivery to TAY in a community setting, as well as finding promising preliminary outcome data. Additional studies are required to determine long-term sexual and reproductive post-intervention behavioral changes in comparison to a control group.},

	abstract = {Limited rigorous research has been conducted to evaluate the impact of interventions designed to promote the successful transitions of young people exiting foster care. The current study builds on previous experimental evaluations of the My Life Model (MLM) for self-determination enhancement, which demonstrated effectiveness in improving educational and transition-to-adulthood outcomes for youth in foster care with disabilities, including those with mental health challenges. The model features one-on-one youth-directed coaching and near-peer mentoring to increase self-determination and goal achievement. The current study was the first to test the impact of the model with a diverse population-based cohort of youth aged 16.5-18.5 in foster care (N = 293), including those with and without disabilities, on key model outcome indicators of self-determination and self-efficacy. This study also explored potential moderation by disability status, trauma symptoms, placement stability, and placement restrictiveness. Findings show that, compared to the randomized control group, the treatment group had greater post-intervention and one-year follow-up gains on several indicators of self-determination. Moderation analysis demonstrated no difference in intervention effectiveness for youth with or without disabilities, suggesting the universality of this approach. Findings also suggest that foster youth participants with low-to-average risks in terms of placement stability, placement restrictiveness, and traumatic stress levels seem to benefit most from the intervention, although youth who are at higher risk due to placement instability, high placement restriction, and high traumatic stress still showed some benefit of participating in the intervention on some measures. My Life is one of only a few intervention models with experimental evidence of effectiveness with older youth in foster care. This validation study establishes that the approach has benefits for both youth with and without disabilities and provides the first information available on the influence of critical barriers facing many youth in care.},

	abstract = {Youth aging out of foster care system normally face multiple disadvantages in terms of educational attainment, employment, housing, financial stability, and life skills compared with children in the general population. About two-thirds of eligible youth in care receive Independent Living Programs (ILPs), which are designed to support youth and ensure a successful transition to adulthood. The objective of this paper is to examine whether ILPs are effectively promoting better outcomes (e.g., educational attainment, employment, housing) for youth aging out of foster care. Using data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), this study used Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) to investigate how different services from ILPs impact the educational attainment, employment, and homelessness of youth aging out of foster care across all 50 states in the United States. The study sample included youth in foster care from a FY 2014 cohort (N = 5633) on Wave 3 at age 21. Controlling for all the covariates, youth who received post-secondary educational support, budget and financial management, and financial assistance for education were more likely to achieve higher educational attainment. Youth who received post-secondary educational support and supervised independent living were more likely to get employed. The results indicated that certain types of ILPs services were associated with positive outcomes in terms of education, employment and housing. Post-secondary educational support service was found to be the most effective type of service for improving all the outcomes. The findings suggest the importance of providing ILPs to youth aging out of foster care. In addition, variation in service delivery and implementation fidelity across states must be taken into consideration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

	abstract = {The transition from adolescence to adulthood in the United States has become longer and less predictable over the past several decades. This chapter summarizes recent research in the United States providing evidence of the benefits of allowing youth in foster care to remain in care through their 21st birthdays. The chapter provides relevant background information about the foster care system in the United States. It describes two studies that have considered the relationship between extended foster care and young people's outcomes during the transition to adulthood. The chapter then summarizes the findings of those studies regarding the potential benefits of extended care, and discusses the implications of the studies' findings. Corporate parenting of youth in transition to adulthood is fundamentally different in crucial ways from caring for minor children, as policy-makers in California found out during the extensive planning process that went into the implementation of extended care there. As child welfare systems around the world increasingly continue to support young people in care into adulthood, research will be needed to ensure that these new care systems meet the needs of the young adults they serve.

The law ensured that, starting January 1, 2012, eligible foster youth had the right to stay in care until their 21st birthday. In addition to having the largest state foster care population in the US, California's county-administered foster care system draws the attention of many other states to California's implementation of extended care (Courtney, Charles, Okpych, Napolitano, \& Halsted, 2014). Leveraging youth survey data and administrative data, this memo investigates youth- and system-level factors associated with the length of time that foster youth in California remain in out-of-home care after their 18th birthday. Understanding factors associated with youths' extended foster care (EFC) participation is important, not only for predicting future demands for the program, but also for identifying subgroups that may be excluded from extended care. The authors find that youth characteristics are associated with youths' stays in care past their 18th birthday, but the change in state policy that occurred in 2012 and between-county variation in participation in EFC play much larger roles.},

	abstract = {Although foster youth approaching the transition to adulthood have postsecondary educational aspirations similar to those of young people in the general population, for too many foster youth with these aspirations, a college education remains an unfulfilled dream. Previous analyses of data from the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (the Midwest Study) suggested that young people may be more likely to pursue their postsecondary educational goals if they are allowed to remain in foster care until age 21 rather than 18, as has traditionally been the case. This issue brief reviews the data that were initially reported and presents more-recent data from the same longitudinal study regarding the relationship between postsecondary educational attainment and extending foster care until age 21. It is clear from the Midwest Study data that at least some former foster youth pursue their education beyond age 21. The proportion of Midwest Study participants who had completed at least one year of college rose from 29.6 percent at age 21 to 37.4 percent at age 23 or 24. However, only 6.2 percent of the 23- or 24-year-olds had graduated from college with either an associate's or a bachelor's degree. This means that just 16 percent of the former foster youth who had completed at least one year of college were college graduates by age 23 or 24. The authors explore possible barriers to educational attainment that may confront these young people. (Contains 2 figures and 6 footnotes.)},

	abstract = {Major strides have been made in the field of youth development. However, youth transitioning into adulthood have not received similar attention. These older youth have frequently been overlooked by policymakers and practitioners who have been more focused on designing programs and services for adolescents and young children. Because older youth face a unique set of challenges and risks as they move into adulthood, it is important to identify intervention strategies that can enhance the development and success of these individuals in domains such as employment, independent living, drug and alcohol use, pregnancy, parenting, life skills, mental health, release from the foster care system, homelessness, violence, education, and literacy. This synthesis examines the role that programs designed to serve older youth can play in promoting positive development and subsequent self-sufficiency in adulthood. The authors synthesize the findings from 31 studies that implemented random assignment intent-to-treat experimental evaluations to examine the impacts of various intervention strategies on youth well-being outcomes during the transition to adulthood (ages 18 to 25). While all programs evaluated outcomes for these "emerging adults," programs varied in the ages of targeted youth: 10 programs targeted youth from as early as 12 years and into their early twenties; eight programs served youth from 16 years and into their early twenties; and 11 programs began at 18 years of age. This review of experimental evaluations indicates that education and career programs can be effective, especially for low income youth and for youth targeted from younger ages, for example, those under age 18. Furthermore, specific intervention strategies, such as mentoring, case management, and providing child care for young parents, are associated with program success across outcomes. However, existing substance use and reproductive health programs have not consistently been found to be effective across outcomes for this age group. (Contains 1 footnote and 11 endnotes.)

Of the 37 eligible studies identified, 13 were selected for final review. Data was analyzed using a narrative method.ResultsFoster care leavers identified themselves as adult and were quite confident about their future and potential for independent living. They had different coping strategies and profiles, but often faced the same challenges in finding employment, education and having a person whom they could rely on. Among the factors that supported the transition to independent living were care leavers’ personal characteristics, certain care-specific features, good education, sufficient prerequisites for a safe life and social support.ConclusionsThis review looked at various descriptive studies based on different conceptual perspectives, cultural contexts and methodologies. The evidence, however, still remains relatively insubstantial.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences, feelings, and perspectives of mentors who work with foster care youth who have aged out of the foster care system. The study's theoretical framework was a combination of socio-motivational theory and empowerment theory. Content analysis was used to examine data from in-depth interviews with the 11 professional mentors who participated in this study. Common themes were organized to present participants' experiences and views regarding their careers as mentors, and the services they provide to foster care youth and foster care graduates. All participants viewed their work as essential in helping foster care graduates to become independent and self-sufficient. Implications for positive social change include creating standardized life skills courses for foster youth before they emancipate and changing government policy to ensure funds are allocated for housing while foster care graduates are enrolled in college or a trade school.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between housing status and health care access and outcomes among young adults aging out of the child welfare system.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study
SETTING: Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Baseline interviews were conducted between May 2002 and March 2003 and follow-up interviews, between March and December 2004.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were foster youth aged 17 or 18 years in Illinois, Wisconsin, or Iowa. We invited a random sample of 67\% of eligible Illinois youth and all eligible youth from Wisconsin and Iowa to participate. Researchers interviewed 749 at baseline (94.7\% response) and 643 at follow-up (85.8\%); we excluded 8 participants without housing data (n=635). We included only the 345 emancipated participants in analyses of health care access. MAIN EXPOSURE Housing status after emancipation: stable housing; unstable housing; or homeless.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of association between main exposure variables with 3 measures of access to care and 2 health outcomes.
RESULTS: Among the 345 emancipated participants, 14.2\% experienced homelessness and 39.4\% were unstably housed. In multivariate analysis of emancipated participants, homelessness was associated with being uninsured (AOR, 3.41; 95\% confidence interval, 1.52-7.63) and having unmet need for health care (AOR, 3.26; 95\% confidence interval, 1.40-7.56); it was not associated with not having had ambulatory care. In multivariate analysis of all participants, housing status was not associated with reporting fair or poor health at follow-up or, among women, with having had a pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Having had an episode of homelessness after emancipation is associated with worse health access, but not worse outcomes, among youth emancipated from foster care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the fit of a theoretically driven conceptual model of pathways to STI risk among foster youth transitioning to adulthood. The model included: 1) historical abuse and foster care experiences, 2) mental health and attachment style in late adolescence, and 3) STI risk in young adulthood. METHOD(S): We used path analysis to analyze data from a longitudinal study of 732 youth transitioning out of foster care. Covariates included gender, race and an inverse probability weight. We also performed moderation analyses comparing models constrained and unconstrained by gender. RESULT(S): Thirty percent reported they or a partner had been diagnosed with an STI. Probability of other measured STI risk behaviors ranged from 9\% (having sex for money) to 79\% (inconsistent condom use). Overall model fit was good (Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual of 0.026). Increased risk of oppositional/delinquent behaviors mediated an association between abuse history and STI risk, via increased inconsistent condom use. There was also a borderline association with having greater than 5 partners. Having a very close relationship with a caregiver and remaining in foster care beyond age 18 decreased STI risk. Moderation analysis revealed better model fit when coefficients were allowed to vary by gender versus a constrained model, but few significant differences in individual path coefficients were found between male and female-only models.. CONCLUSION(S): Interventions/policies that: 1) address externalizing trauma sequelae, 2) promote close, stable substitute caregiver relationships, and 3) extend care to age 21 years have the potential to decrease STI risk in this population.},

	abstract = {Despite the critical need for effective programs for older youth exiting from foster care, little is known about the outcomes of transition support programs or how they are perceived by youth. This study sought to understand youth outcomes and perceptions of an innovative, statewide program using a youth-driven team decision-making model in transition planning meetings. A pre-post design involved data collection from youth and caseworkers. At 3-month follow up, significant improvements occurred in the youth’s perceptions of support deficits, confidence they could access services, financial and housing security, employment, and legal issues. Qualitative findings from open-ended questions suggest that the transition meetings were helpful as they provided an opportunity to plan and set goals that went beyond planning that had already occurred. Providing all youth with a collaborative, supportive process with trained external facilitators may support greater access to services and improved perceptions of readiness for independent living after discharge.

	abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the federal government has increased supports that promote college success for foster youth (Okpych, 2012), such as the \$5,000 education and training voucher that foster youth can use each year toward college expenses. A key piece of federal legislation supporting foster youth is the 2008 Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, which gives states the option to extend the age limit of foster care up to youths' 21st birthday (Courtney, Dworsky, \& Napolitano, 2013). Youth participating in extended foster care receive services past their 18th birthday that could impact their likelihood of going to college, such as subsidized housing, access to child welfare professionals, and other resources. In fact, enrolling in college and making satisfactory academic progress is one of the five eligibility criteria for participating in extended care. To date, little research has evaluated the impact of extended foster care on early college outcomes. The current study draws on a large sample of youth from administrative California child welfare records, including youth who were in care before and after California's extended foster care law (Assembly Bill 12, or AB12) was enacted. This memo estimates the impact that California's extended foster care law had on postsecondary education enrollment and persistence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developing robust evidence is a challenge for researchers working with disadvantaged or vulnerable populations. For example, research shows that young people who have transitioned from out-of-home care (OOHC) to independent adulthood often experience poor long-term outcomes. However, evidence for the aetiology of those outcomes is weak due to methodological limitations such as small sample sizes and a lack of longitudinal data. This paper details the protocol for Navigating Through Life, a study that utilises novel research methods to better understand the pathways and outcomes of young people as they leave OOHC in Western Australia (WA).
METHODS: Navigating Through Life is a longitudinal, mixed methods, population-based study. A prospective longitudinal study of young people aged 15-25 years will follow participants' experiences and outcomes over a two-year period. Quantitative and qualitative data is being collected from participants five times over 2 years, using standardised outcome measures and individual interviews. Outcome measures focus on key dimensions of young people's lives (e.g., social inclusion, well-being, resilience, self-determination). Interviews examine important influences and the variable contexts into which young people have transitioned from care. In addition, retrospective population-level data for young people transitioning from OOHC will be obtained from linked Western Australian government administrative records. Using a multitude of data sources, analysis will map pathways and outcomes of young people with care experience, and comparisons will be made with other population groups within WA.
DISCUSSION: Navigating Through Life exemplifies a novel utilisation of multiple data sources to research outcomes for vulnerable and difficult to reach populations, and offers insights for other complex mixed-methods longitudinal studies. Results will provide new and more comprehensive data about specific pathways that may be influential to a range of post-care outcomes. Findings will extend evidence to inform better service-delivery models that improve outcomes and reduce disparities for vulnerable young people.},

However, no previous reviews have comprehensively addressed this issue to identify future research needs. The aim of this systematic review was to gather, assess, and synthesize previous studies concerning care leavers’ high-risk behavior. The search was conducted in six databases, with sixteen articles included in the final review. The selected research highlighted five forms of high-risk behavior: substance abuse, delinquency, sexual behavior, irresponsible use of money, and self-destructive behavior. The incidence of high-risk behavior among care leavers varied noticeably between the studies. Some of the studies reported significant connections between high-risk behavior and gender, race, reason(s) for placement, and the form and number of placements. The synthesized findings revealed a fragmented, limited view of care leavers’ high-risk behavior that highlighted substance abuse and delinquency. The development of adolescents, particularly care leavers, includes multiple factors that have either a conducive or protecting effect for high-risk behavior. Comprehensive research regarding care leavers’ high-risk behavior, including the associated factors, is needed to better support healthy development and success in transitioning to independent living.},

Supportive interventions that aid youth in the reentry to their communities can be crucial for successful reintegration. In systematic reviews (SR) on this topic, only specific interventions or programs are described. Therefore, a summary of evidence about transitional interventions for various groups of reentry youth is needed. Method This overview of SRs was preregistered in PROSPERO. We searched PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Campbell Library, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Social Care Online, and Epistemonikos. SRs that fit the search criteria were evaluated using the AMSTAR checklist for methodological quality and the GRADE tool for assessing confidence in effect estimates. Results We screened 2,349 publications for eligibility. Eight SRs were included for analysis. The methodological quality of five SRs was critically low, two were of low quality, and one was of moderate quality. Recidivism was reported as the only outcome in five SRs. Detrimental outcomes were reported in five SRs. Confidence in effect estimates was low or very low for all outcomes. Ninety-five percent of primary study populations were from the United States. Conclusion We offer a rigorous appraisal of SRs on transitional interventions. The gaps of knowledge are vast regarding what works, how it works, and for whom. Development of a knowledge base should include defining the term ‘recidivism’, systematic reporting of demographics, and identifying effective common elements.},

This study used administrative data linked at the individual level for a cohort of Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) children to follow and extend a model developed by Drake et al. In this investigation, we aimed to build an understanding of the high representation of indigenous NZ children in administratively sourced measures of CA/N. Variation in rate ratios (RRs) within infant mortality and birth outcomes considered as possible proxies for actual CA/N RRs leaves open a range of interpretations. Our findings indicate that a more nuanced interpretation of the overrepresentation of indigenous children in administratively recorded maltreatment statistics is required. Rather than considering risk and bias as competing explanations, we suggest an acknowledgment of the impact of colonization and the existence of systemic bias generating increased risk as key drivers. As linked administrative data are increasingly used for research and evaluation, and considered for use in supporting decision making, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the drivers of administratively recorded CA/N in order to effectively address the needs of indigenous populations.},

The purpose of this paper is to update evidence about the relationship between poverty and child abuse and neglect (CAN) published since a previous report in 2016 (Bywaters et al., 2016). A systematic search was conducted, identifying seven reviews. Poverty was found to be consistently and strongly associated with maltreatment, be that in terms of familial or community-level poverty, or in terms of economic security. Findings demonstrated that both the type and the quantity of economic insecurities impacted child maltreatment. Certain economic insecurities – income losses, cumulative material hardship and housing hardship – reliably predicted future child maltreatment. Likewise, as families experienced more material hardship, the risk for maltreatment intensified. In some studies, the relationship between poverty and maltreatment differed by abuse type. Future reviews need to investigate individual papers and their findings across different CAN measures, definitions, samples, abuse types and conceptualisations of poverty to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current research base and the directions which need to be taken to further understand and prevent CAN.},

	abstract = {Young people living in residential out-of-home care (OOHC) comprise a small proportion of the total Australian OOHC population, but are known to be a particularly vulnerable group. Those transitioning from residential care at 18 years or younger seem to have poorer outcomes than those leaving foster care and kinship care. The recent introduction of forms of extended care until 21 years in most Australian jurisdictions has highlighted the need for additional assistance for all care leavers, yet paradoxically residential care leavers currently receive the least ongoing support. This critical commentary draws on recent relevant research findings and policy developments with regard to extended care locally and internationally. It presents the case for the concept of extended care to be adopted, via a nationally consistent model of extended care support for all residential care leavers incorporating formal housing and other support programs.},
